# 1.2 A First Program

We begin our study of Java with a **program** that **prints** a **message**（消息；信息） **greet**ing（问候） the world.

## Example 1

```java
class Greet
{
   // This program prints a simple message
   public static void main (String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println("Hello, world");
   }
}
```

Let us look **in detail**（详细地） at the **component**s（部件；元件；组成部分） of the program in Example 1.

1. `class`
    
    All Java programs are **contain**ed（包含） in a **class**（类）. The start of a class is **indicate**d（表明；指明） by the **reserved word**（保留字） **class**. Java **contains** about fifty **reserved words**, all of which are **list**ed（列出） **later**（后来；稍后） in this chapter.

2. `Greet`
   
    This is the name that **identifies**（identify 识别，认出） the **class**. **Customarily**（照例；通常；习惯上）, **classes** have names that **start with**（以 ... 开始） an **upper case**（大写） letter. We **chose**（choose 选择，过去时） the name **Greet** because the program **greets** the world but we **could have called**（也可以将其称作，虚拟语气） it FirstProgram if we had chosen to do so. **In fact**（事实上）, **as far as the computer is concerned**（就计算机而言，as far as ... is concerned）, we **could have called** the class Athena or Saskatoon but it is better, **for the benefit of**（为了 ... 的利益） your human readers, to use a **meaningful**（有意义的） name.

{ }
The beginning and end of any section of a Java program are indicated by brace brackets, { and }. The beginning and end of the class are indicated by the { in the second line and the } in the last line of the program.

// This program ...
The two adjacent slashes indicate a comment in a Java program. Anything on a line after // is ignored by the compiler. Although they do not affect the way that the program works, comments can be very useful to any person trying to understand a program. A comment can also be indicated in a Java program by using /* to start the comment and */ to end it. Using this style, we could have written our comment as /* This program prints a simple message */ Usually, comments that appear entirely on one line are written using the // style while those that occupy multiple lines are written using the /* ... */ style.

public static void main (String[] args)
Java programs consist of one or more methods, (sometimes called functions or procedures in other programming languages). If the program is run directly by the Java interpreter, then exactly one of its methods must be called main. (Such programs are sometimes called application programs. As we will see later when we study applets, Java has other types of programs that do not have a main method.) Our program has only one method so it must be called main. This line is the header of the main method. The other words and symbols in the header will be explained later. For now, just use them, exactly as shown.

{ }
The inner pair of brace brackets defines the beginning and end of the definition of the main method, just as the outer pair of brace brackets defines the limits of the definition of the class.

System.out.println("Hello, world");
This statement calls on a method called println to send the string of characters Hello world contained in double quotes to some output device (probably your computer's screen). Whatever the output device is, we can think of it as a page of paper. The println method, given a string of characters, writes the string on the page and then moves on to the next line of the page, ready to print the next item, if there is one. As we suggested in discussing the header of the method, the details of the use of println will be made clear later. For now, just use it exactly as shown, with an upper case S on System, dots between System, out, and println, and including both the parentheses and the terminating semi-colon.
