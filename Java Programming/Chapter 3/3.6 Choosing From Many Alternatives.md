# 3.6 Choosing From Many Alternatives

**Decision**s(决定；判定) with many **possible**(可能的) **choice**s(选项) can be **handle**d(处理) using **nest**ed(嵌套) if **statement**s but Java has another **statement**, the `switch`(开关) statement, that often makes choosing from many **alternative**s(选项) an **easier**(easy 的比较级) **task**(任务).

## Example 1

**To see**(动词不定式在句首表示为了) how a `switch` **statement** works, **suppose**(假设) that we are writing a program that **acts as**(act as 担任；充当) a **simple**(简单的) **calculator**(计算器). If **at some point**(在某一时刻) we have two **numerical**(数字的；数值的) **value**s(值) (**operand**1(操作数) and operand2) and a `char` **variable**(变量) **operator** with **possible** **value**s `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, or `'/'`, **then**(那么) the following **fragment**(片段) will print the **value** of the **corresponding**(对应的) **expression**(表达式).

```java
switch (operator)
{
    case '+' : System.out.println(operand1 + operand2);
               break;
    case '-' : System.out.println(operand1 - operand2);
               break;
    case '*' : System.out.println(operand1 * operand2);
               break;
    case '/' : System.out.println(operand1 / operand2);
               break;
}
```

In **executing**(execute 执行) this **statement**, Java first **determine**s(决定) the **value** of **operator**. **Then**(然后), **based on**(以...为基础； 基于) this **value**, it **start**s(开始；出发) to **execute** the code **inside**(在...里面) the **brace bracket**s(花括号), **start**ing at the **point**(点；地点) **indicate**d(指出) by the **appropriate**(适当的) `case`. The `break;` statements **cause**(引起；使发生) Java to stop **executing** statements **inside** the `switch` and to **jump down to**(跳到) the point **just**(正好；恰好) after the switch. For example, if `operand1 = 3`, `operand2 = 4`, and `operator = '*'`, Java would print the **value** of `3 * 4` and then **exit**(退出) the `switch`.

In the example, the final break; is not necessary but it is a good programming practice to put it there to make sure that the switch will still work correctly even if, at some later time, an extra case is added to it. As others have noted, a little extra redundancy is often a good idea.

To guard against the possibility that no case matches the value of the expression in the switch, we can (and should) include a default case that contains statements to execute if there is no match. We can also have more than one case value associated with the same statements. Both of these ideas are illustrated in the next example.

 

Example 2
This switch statement assigns a grade based on a quiz that was scored out of five.

 

switch (score)

{

       case 5: grade = 'A';

               break;

       case 4: grade = 'B';

               break;

       case 3: grade = 'C';

               break;

       case 2:

       case 1:

       case 0:  grade = 'F';

       default: System.out.println("Invalid score" + " - grade of ? assigned");

                grade = '?';

                break;

}

 

 


 

In any switch statement, the expression that controls it must have some integer value (byte, short, int, long, or char). This expression is usually simply a variable but it can be an arbitrarily complex

 expression; the case values, on the other hand, must be constants. The order of the cases is arbitrary. If there is no default case and the value of the expression does not match any of the cases, then

the statement does nothing (and Java gives no error message).

 

 

Exercise 3.6
1.       Rewrite the following using the indentation style shown in the text. 
 
switch(month){case l: case 3:case 5:case 7:case 8:case 10 :case 12:1ength=31;
break;case 4:case 6:case 9:case 11: length=30;break;case 2:if(isLeapYear)length=29;else length=28;break;}
 
2.       a) In Example 1, what would the fragment print if operand1 = 8,    operand2 = 2, and operator = '-'?
       b) What would be printed with these values if there were no break; statements in the switch statement? 
 
 
3.       A sequence of six tests, all scored out of 100, are to be given different weightings in determining a final mark. Write a program fragment that computes the appropriate weighted score for one test. The fragment should first read values of testNumber and score. 
Using a switch statement, it should then compute and print the appropriate value of weightedScore using the weightings given in the following table.
 
Test Number

Weight

1

10%

2

20%

3

20%

4

15%

5

15%

6

20%

 
 
       For example, input of 
       3
       27
       Should produce output of
       
A score of 27 on test 3 gives a weighted score of 5.4
 
 
4.         Write a program fragment that prints, as a word, the value of the last digit of the int variable number. For example, if the value of number is 547, the fragment should print 
    
The last digit of 547 is seven.

 

    
   
5.       Write a program that reads a date in numeric form as a year followed by a month followed by a day and then prints the date as one might on a cheque. For example, input of 
 

2000 
7
 1 
should produce output of 
July 1, 2000
