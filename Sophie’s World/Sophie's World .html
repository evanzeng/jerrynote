&hellip; at some point something must have come from nothing &hellip;
</P>

</P>
<p>
Sophie Amundsen was on her way home from school. She had walked the
first part of the way with Joanna. They had been discussing robots.
Joanna thought the human brain was like an advanced computer.
Sophie was not certain she agreed. Surely a person was more than a
piece of hardware?</P>
<p>
When they got to the supermarket they went their separate ways.
Sophie lived on the outskirts of a sprawling suburb and had almost
twice as far to school as Joanna. There were no other houses beyond
her garden, which made it seem as if her house lay at the end of the
world. This was where the woods began.</P>
<p>
She turned the corner into Clover Close. At the end of the road there
was a sharp bend, known as Captain&rsquo;s Bend. People seldom went
that way except on the weekend.</P>
<p>
It was early May. In some of the gardens the fruit trees were
encircled with dense clusters of daffodils. The birches were already
in pale green leaf.</P>
<p>
It was extraordinary how everything burst forth at this time of year!
What made this great mass of green vegetation come welling up
from the dead earth as soon as it got warm and the last traces of
snow disappeared?</P>
<p>
As Sophie opened her garden gate, she looked in the mailbox. There
was usually a lot of junk mail and a few big envelopes for her
mother, a pile to dump on the kitchen table before she went up to her
room to start her homework.</P>
<p>
From time to time there would be a few letters from the bank for her
father, but then he was not a normal father. Sophie&rsquo;s father
was the captain of a big oil tanker, and was away for most of the
year. During the few weeks at a time when he was at home, he would
shuffle around the house making it nice and cozy for Sophie and her
mother. But when he was at sea he could seem very distant.</P>
<p>
There was only one letter in the mailbox&mdash;and it was for Sophie.
The white envelope read: &ldquo;Sophie Amundsen, 3 Clover
Close.&rdquo; That was all; it did not say who it was from. There was
no stamp on it either.</P>
<p>
As soon as Sophie had closed the gate behind her she opened the
envelope. It contained only a slip of paper no bigger than the
envelope. It read: <I>Who are you?</I></P>
<p>
Nothing else, only the three words, written by hand, and followed by
a large question mark.</P>
<p>
She looked at the envelope again. The letter was definitely for
her. Who could have dropped it in the mailbox?</P>
<p>
Sophie let herself quickly into the red house. As always, her
cat Sherekan managed to slink out of the bushes, jump onto the front
step, and slip in through the door before she closed it behind her.</P><br />
<p>
Whenever Sophie&rsquo;s mother was in a bad mood, she would call the
house they lived in a menagerie. A menagerie was a collection of
animals. Sophie certainly had one and was quite happy with it. It had
begun with the three goldfish, Goldtop, Red Ridinghood, and Black
Jack. Next she got two budgerigars called Smitt and Smule, then
Govinda the tortoise, and finally the marmalade cat Sherekan.
They had all been given to her to make up for the fact that her
mother never got home from work until late in the afternoon and her
father was away so much, sailing all over the world.</P>
<p>
Sophie slung her schoolbag on the floor and put a bowl of cat food
out for Sherekan. Then she sat down on a kitchen stool with the
mysterious letter in her hand.</P>
<p>
<I>Who are you?</I></P>
<p>
She had no idea. She was Sophie Amundsen, of course, but who was
that? She had not really figured that out&mdash;yet.</P>
<p>
What if she had been given a different name? Anne Knutsen, for
instance. Would she then have been someone else?</P>
<p>
She suddenly remembered that Dad had originally wanted her to be
called Lillemor. Sophie tried to imagine herself shaking hands and
introducing herself as Lillemor Amundsen, but it seemed all
wrong. It was someone else who kept introducing herself.</P>
<p>
She jumped up and went into the bathroom with the strange letter in
her hand. She stood in front of the mirror and stared into her
own eyes.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am Sophie Amundsen,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
The girl in the mirror did not react with as much as a twitch.
Whatever Sophie did, she did exactly the same. Sophie tried to beat
her reflection to it with a lightning movement but the other girl was
just as fast.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Sophie asked.</P>
<p>
She received no response to this either, but felt a momentary
confusion as to whether it was she or her reflection who had
asked the question.</P>
<p>
Sophie pressed her index finger to the nose in the mirror and said,
&ldquo;You are me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
As she got no answer to this, she turned the sentence around and
said, &ldquo;I am you.&rdquo;</P><br />
<p>
Sophie Amundsen was often dissatisfied with her appearance. She
was frequently told that she had beautiful almond-shaped eyes, but
that was probably just something people said because her nose was too
small and her mouth was a bit too big. And her ears were much too
close to her eyes. Worst of all was her straight hair, which it was
impossible to do anything with. Sometimes her father would stroke her
hair and call her &ldquo;the girl with the flaxen hair,&rdquo; after
a piece of music by Claude Debussy. It was all right for him, he was
not condemned to living with this straight dark hair. Neither mousse
nor styling gel had the slightest effect on Sophie&rsquo;s hair.
Sometimes she thought she was so ugly that she wondered if she was
malformed at birth. Her mother always went on about her difficult
labor. But was that really what determined how you looked?</P>
<p>
Wasn&rsquo;t it odd that she didn&rsquo;t know who she was? And
wasn&rsquo;t it unreasonable that she hadn&rsquo;t been allowed to
have any say in what she would look like? Her looks had just been
dumped on her. She could choose her own friends, but she certainly
hadn&rsquo;t chosen herself. She had not even chosen to be a human
being.</P>
<p>
What was a human being?</P>
<p>
Sophie looked up at the girl in the mirror again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go upstairs and do my biology homework,&rdquo;
she said, almost apologetically. Once she was out in the hall, she
thought, No, I&rsquo;d rather go out in the garden.</P><br />
<p>
&ldquo;Kitty, kitty, kitty!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie chased the cat out onto the doorstep and closed the front door
behind her.</P>
<p>
As she stood outside on the gravel path with the mysterious
letter in her hand, the strangest feeling came over her. She felt
like a doll that had suddenly been brought to life by the wave of a
magic wand.</P>
<p>
Wasn&rsquo;t it extraordinary to be in the world right now, wandering
around in a wonderful adventure!</P>
<p>
Sherekan sprang lightly across the gravel and slid into a dense clump
of red-currant bushes. A live cat, vibrant with energy from its white
whiskers to the twitching tail at the end of its sleek body. It was
here in the garden too, but hardly aware of it in the same way as
Sophie.</P>
<p>
As Sophie started to think about being alive, she began to
realize that she would not be alive forever. I am in the world now,
she thought, but one day I shall be gone.</P>
<p>
Was there a life after death? This was another question the cat
was blissfully unaware of.</P>
<p>
It was not long since Sophie&rsquo;s grandmother had died. For more
than six months Sophie had missed her every single day. How unfair
that life had to end!</P>
<p>
Sophie stood on the gravel path, thinking. She tried to think extra
hard about being alive so as to forget that she would not be alive
forever. But it was impossible. As soon as she concentrated on being
alive now, the thought of dying also came into her mind. The same
thing happened the other way around: only by conjuring up an intense
feeling of one day being dead could she appreciate how terribly good
it was to be alive. It was like two sides of a coin that she kept
turning over and over. And the bigger and clearer one side of the
coin became, the bigger and clearer the other side became too.</P>
<p>
You can&rsquo;t experience being alive without realizing that you
have to die, she thought. But it&rsquo;s just as impossible to
realize you have to die without thinking how incredibly amazing it is
to be alive.</P>
<p>
Sophie remembered Granny saying something like that the day the
doctor told her she was ill. &ldquo;I never realized how rich life
was until now,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
How tragic that most people had to get ill before they understood
what a gift it was to be alive. Or else they had to find a mysterious
letter in the mailbox!</P>
<p>
Perhaps she should go and see if any more letters had arrived. Sophie
hurried to the gate and looked inside the green mailbox. She was
startled to find that it contained another white envelope, exactly
like the first. But the mailbox had definitely been empty when she
took the first envelope! This envelope had her name on it as well.
She tore it open and fished out a note the same size as the first
one.</P>
<p>
<I>Where does the world come from?</I> it said.</P>
<p>
I don&rsquo;t know, Sophie thought. Surely nobody really knows. And
yet&mdash;Sophie thought it was a fair question. For the first time
in her life she felt it wasn&rsquo;t right to live in the world
without at least inquiring where it came from.</P>
<p>
The mysterious letters had made Sophie&rsquo;s head spin. She decided
to go and sit in the den.</P>
<p>
The den was Sophie&rsquo;s top secret hiding place. It was where she
went when she was terribly angry, terribly miserable, or terribly
happy. Today she was simply confused.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
*        *        *</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
The red house was surrounded by a large garden with lots of
flowerbeds, fruit bushes, fruit trees of different kinds, a spacious
lawn with a glider and a little gazebo that Granddad had built for
Granny when she lost their first child a few weeks after it was born.
The child&rsquo;s name was Marie. On her gravestone were the words:
&ldquo;Little Marie to us came, greeted us, and left again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Down in a corner of the garden behind all the raspberry bushes
was a dense thicket where neither flowers nor berries would grow.
Actually, it was an old hedge that had once marked the boundary to
the woods, but because nobody had trimmed it for the last twenty
years it had grown into a tangled and impenetrable mass. Granny used
to say the hedge made it harder for the foxes to take the chickens
during the war, when the chickens had free range of the garden.</P>
<p>
To everyone but Sophie, the old hedge was just as useless as the
rabbit hutches at the other end of the garden. But that was only
because they hadn&rsquo;t discovered Sophie&rsquo;s secret.</P>
<p>
Sophie had known about the little hole in the hedge for as long as
she could remember. When she crawled through it she came into a large
cavity between the bushes. It was like a little house. She knew
nobody would find her there.</P>
<p>
Clutching the two envelopes in her hand, Sophie ran through the
garden, crouched down on all fours, and wormed her way through the
hedge. The den was almost high enough for her to stand upright, but
today she sat down on a clump of gnarled roots. From there she could
look out through tiny peepholes between the twigs and leaves.
Although none of the holes was bigger than a small coin, she had a
good view of the whole garden. When she was little she used to think
it was fun to watch her mother and father searching for her among the
trees.</P>
<p>
Sophie had always thought the garden was a world of its own. Each
time she heard about the Garden of Eden in the Bible it reminded her
of sitting here in the den, surveying her own little paradise.</P><br />	
<p>
Where does the world come from?</P>
<p>
She hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea. Sophie knew that the world was
only a small planet in space. But where did space come from?</P>
<p>
It was possible that space had always existed, in which case she
would not also need to figure out where it came from. But could
anything have always existed? Something deep down inside her
protested at the idea. Surely everything that exists must have had a
beginning? So space must sometime have been created out of something
else.</P>
<p>
But if space had come from something else, then that something else
must also have come from something. Sophie felt she was only
deferring the problem. At some point, something must have come from
nothing. But was that possible? Wasn&rsquo;t that just as impossible
as the idea that the world had always existed?</P>
<p>
They had learned at school that God created the world. Sophie tried
to console herself with the thought that this was probably the best
solution to the whole problem. But then she started to think again.
She could accept that God had created space, but what about God
himself? Had he created himself out of nothing? Again there was
something deep down inside her that protested. Even though God
could create all kinds of things, he could hardly create himself
before he had a &ldquo;self&rdquo; to create with. So there was only
one possibility left: God had always existed. But she had already
rejected that possibility! Everything that existed had to have a
beginning.</P>
<p>
Oh, drat!</P>
<p>
She opened the two envelopes again.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
<I>Who are you?</I></P>
<p>
<I>Where does the world come from?</I></P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
What annoying questions! And anyway where did the letters come from?
That was just as mysterious, almost.</P>
<p>
Who had jolted Sophie out of her everyday existence and suddenly
brought her face to face with the great riddles of the universe?</P><br />
<p>
For the third time Sophie went to the mailbox. The mailman had just
delivered the day&rsquo;s mail. Sophie fished out a bulky pile of
junk mail, periodicals, and a couple of letters for her mother. There
was also a postcard of a tropical beach. She turned the card over. It
had a Norwegian stamp on it and was postmarked &ldquo;UN
Battalion.&rdquo; Could it be from Dad? But wasn&rsquo;t he in a
completely different place? It wasn&rsquo;t his handwriting either.</P>
<p>
Sophie felt her pulse quicken a little as she saw who the postcard
was addressed to: &ldquo;Hilde Moller Knag, c/o Sophie Amundsen, 3
Clover Close ...&rdquo; The rest of the address was correct. The card
read:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, Happy 15th birthday! As I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll
understand, I want to give you a present that will help you grow.
Forgive me for sending the card c/o Sophie. It was the easiest way.
Love from Dad.</P>
<p>
Sophie raced back to the house and into the kitchen. Her mind was in
a turmoil. Who was this &ldquo;Hilde,&rdquo; whose fifteenth birthday
was just a month before her own?</P>
<p>
Sophie got out the telephone book. There were a lot of people called
Moller, and quite a few called Knag. But there was nobody in the
entire directory called Moller Knag.</P>
<p>
She examined the mysterious card again. It certainly seemed genuine
enough; it had a stamp and a postmark.</P>
<p>
Why would a father send a birthday card to Sophie&rsquo;s address
when it was quite obviously intended to go somewhere else? What kind
of father would cheat his own daughter of a birthday card by
purposely sending it astray? How could it be &ldquo;the easiest way&rdquo;?
And above all, how was she supposed to trace this Hilde person?</P>
<p>
So now Sophie had another problem to worry about. She tried to get
her thoughts in order:</P>
<p>
This afternoon, in the space of two short hours, she had been
presented with three problems. The first problem was who had put
the two white envelopes in her mailbox. The second was the difficult
questions these letters contained. The third problem was who Hilde
Moller Knag could be, and why Sophie had been sent her birthday card.
She was sure that the three problems were interconnected in some way.
They had to be, because until today she had lived a perfectly
ordinary life.</P><br /><br />
<H3>The   Top Hat</H3>
<p>
&hellip; the only thing we require to be good philosophers is the
faculty of wonder...</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie was sure she would hear from the anonymous letter writer
again. She decided not to tell anyone about the letters for the time
being.</P>
<p>
At school she had trouble concentrating on what the teachers said.
They seemed to talk only about unimportant things. Why couldn&rsquo;t
they talk about what a human being is&mdash;or about what the world
is and how it came into being?</P>
<p>
For the first time she began to feel that at school as well as
everywhere else people were only concerned with trivialities. There
were major problems that needed to be solved.</P>
<p>
Did anybody have answers to these questions? Sophie felt that
thinking about them was more important than memorizing irregular
verbs.</P>
<p>
When the bell rang after the last class, she left the school so fast
that Joanna had to run to catch up with her.</P>
<p>
After a while Joanna said, &ldquo;Do you want to play cards this
evening?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie shrugged her shoulders.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that interested in card games any more.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna looked surprised.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not? Let&rsquo;s play badminton then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie stared down at the pavement&mdash;then up at her friend.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m that interested in badminton
either.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie noticed the touch of bitterness in Joanna&rsquo;s tone.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you mind telling me what&rsquo;s suddenly so important?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie just shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ... it&rsquo;s a
secret.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yuck! You&rsquo;re probably in love!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The two girls walked on for a while without saying anything. When
they got to the soccer field Joanna said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
across the field.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Across the field! It was the quickest way for Joanna, but she only
went that way when she had to hurry home in time for visitors or a
dental appointment.</P>
<p>
Sophie regretted having been mean to her. But what else could she
have said? That she had suddenly become so engrossed in who she was
and where the world came from that she had no time to play badminton?
Would Joanna have understood?</P>
<p>
Why was it so difficult to be absorbed in the most vital and, in a
way, the most natural of all questions?</P>
<p>
She felt her heart beating faster as she opened the mailbox. At first
she found only a letter from the bank and some big brown envelopes
for her mother. Darn! Sophie had been looking forward to getting
another letter from the unknown sender.</P>
<p>
As she closed the gate behind her she noticed her own name on one of
the big envelopes. Turning it over, she saw written on the back:
&ldquo;Course in Philosophy. Handle with care.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie ran up the gravel path and flung her schoolbag onto the step.
Stuffing the other letters under the doormat, she ran around
into the back garden and sought refuge in the den. This was the only
place to open the big letter.</P>
<p>
Sherekan came jumping after her but Sophie had to put up with that.
She knew the cat would not give her away.</P>
<p>
Inside the envelope there were three typewritten pages held together
with a paper clip. Sophie began to read.</P>
<br /><H3>WHAT IS PHILOSOPHY?</h3><br />
<p>
Dear Sophie,</P>
<p>
Lots of people have hobbies. Some
people collect old coins or foreign stamps, some do needlework,
others spend most of their spare time on a particular sport.</P>
<p>
A lot of people enjoy reading. But
reading tastes differ widely. Some people only read newspapers or
comics, some like reading novels, while others prefer books on
astronomy, wildlife, or technological discoveries.</P>
<p>
If I happen to be interested in horses
or precious stones, I cannot expect everyone else to share my
enthusiasm. If I watch all the sports programs on TV with great
pleasure, I must put up with the fact that other people find
sports boring.</P>
<p>
Is there nothing that interests us
all? Is there nothing that concerns everyone&mdash;no matter who they
are or where they live in the world? Yes, dear Sophie, there are
questions that certainly should interest everyone. They are
precisely the questions this course is about.</P>
<p>
What is the most important thing in
life? If we ask someone living on the edge of starvation, the answer
is food. If we ask someone dying of cold, the answer is warmth. If we
put the same question to someone who feels lonely and isolated, the
answer will probably be the company of other people.</P>
<p>
But when these basic needs have been
satisfied&mdash;will there still be something that everybody needs?
Philosophers think so. They believe that man cannot live by
bread alone. Of course everyone needs food. And everyone needs love
and care. But there is something else&mdash;apart from that&mdash;which
everyone needs, and that is to figure out who we are and why we are
here.</P>
<p>
Being interested in why we are here is
not a &ldquo;casual&rdquo; interest like collecting stamps. People
who ask such questions are taking part in a debate that has gone
on as long as man has lived on this planet. How the universe, the
earth, and life came into being is a bigger and more important
question than who won the most gold medals in the last Olympics.</P>
<p>
The best way of approaching philosophy
is to ask a few philosophical questions:</P>
<p>
How was the world created? Is there
any will or meaning behind what happens? Is there a life after
death? How can we answer these questions? And most important, how
ought we to live? People have been asking these questions throughout
the ages. We know of no culture which has not concerned itself with
what man is and where the world came from.</P>
<p>
Basically there are not many
philosophical questions to ask. We have already asked some of the
most important ones. But history presents us with many different
answers to each question. So it is easier to ask philosophical
questions than to answer them.</P>
<p>
Today as well each individual has to
discover his own answer to these same questions. You cannot find out
whether there is a God or whether there is life after death by
looking in an encyclopedia. Nor does the encyclopedia tell us
how we ought to live. However, reading what other people have
believed can help us formulate our own view of life.</P>
<p>
Philosophers&rsquo; search for the
truth resembles a detective story. Some think Andersen was the
murderer, others think it was Nielsen or Jensen. The police are
sometimes able to solve a real crime. But it is equally possible that
they never get to the bottom of it, although there is a solution
somewhere. So even if it is difficult to answer a question, there may
be one&mdash;and only one&mdash;right answer. Either there is a kind
of existence after death&mdash;or there is not.</P>
<p>
A lot of age-old enigmas have now been
explained by science. What the dark side of the moon looks like was
once shrouded in mystery. It was not the kind of thing that could be
solved by discussion, it was left to the imagination of the
individual. But today we know exactly what the dark side of the moon
looks like, and no one can &ldquo;believe&rdquo; any longer in
the Man in the Moon, or that the moon is made of green cheese.</P>
<p>
A Greek philosopher who lived more
than two thousand years ago believed that philosophy had its
origin in man&rsquo;s sense of wonder. Man thought it was so
astonishing to be alive that philosophical questions arose of their
own accord.</P>
<p>
It is like watching a magic trick. We
cannot understand how it is done. So we ask: how can the magician
change a couple of white silk scarves into a live rabbit?</P>
<p>
A lot of people experience the world
with the same incredulity as when a magician suddenly pulls a rabbit
out of a hat which has just been shown to them empty.</P>
<p>
In the case of the rabbit, we know the
magician has tricked us. What we would like to know is just how he
did it. But when it comes to the world it&rsquo;s somewhat different.
We know that the world is not all sleight of hand and deception
because here we are in it, we are part of it. Actually, we are the
white rabbit being pulled out of the hat. The only difference between
us and the white rabbit is that the rabbit does not realize it is
taking part in a magic trick. Unlike us. We feel we are part of
something mysterious and we would like to know how it all works.</P>
<p>
P.S. As far as the white rabbit is
concerned, it might be better to compare it with the whole universe.
We who live here are microscopic insects existing deep down in the
rabbit&rsquo;s fur. But philosophers are always trying to climb up
the fine hairs of the fur in order to stare right into the magician&rsquo;s
eyes.</P>
<p>
Are you still there, Sophie? To be
continued . . .</P><br />
<p>
Sophie was completely exhausted. Still there? She could not even
remember if she had taken the time to breathe while she read.</P>
<p>
Who had brought this letter? It couldn&rsquo;t be the same person who
had sent the birthday card to Hilde Moller Knag because that card had
both a stamp and a postmark. The brown envelope had been
delivered by hand to the mailbox exactly like the two white ones.</P>
<p>
Sophie looked at her watch. It was a quarter to three. Her mother
would not be home from work for over two hours.</P>
<p>
Sophie crawled out into the garden again and ran to the mailbox.
Perhaps there was another letter.</P>
<p>
She found one more brown envelope with her name on it. This time she
looked all around but there was nobody in sight. Sophie ran to the
edge of the woods and looked down the path.</P>
<p>
No one was there. Suddenly she thought she heard a twig snap deep in
the woods. But she was not completely sure, and anyway it would
be pointless to chase after someone who was determined to get away.</P>
<p>
Sophie let herself into the house. She ran upstairs to her room and
took out a big cookie tin full of pretty stones. She emptied the
stones onto the floor and put both large envelopes into the tin. Then
she hurried out into the garden again, holding the tin securely with
both hands. Before she went she put some food out for Sherekan.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kitty, kitty, kitty!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Once back in the den she opened the second brown envelope and drew
out the new typewritten pages. She began to read.</P>
<br /><H3>A STRANGE CREATURE</h3><br />
<p>
Hello again! As you see, this short
course in philosophy will come in handy-sized portions. Here are a
few more introductory remarks:</P>
<p>
Did I say that the only thing we
require to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder? If I did
not, I say it now: THE ONLY THING WE REQUIRE TO BE GOOD PHILOSOPHERS
IS THE FACULTY OF WONDER.</P>
<p>
Babies have this faculty. That is not
surprising. After a few short months in the womb they slip out into a
brand-new reality. But as they grow up the faculty of wonder seems to
diminish. Why is this? Do you know?</P>
<p>
If a newborn baby could talk, it would
probably say something about what an extraordinary world it had come
into. We see how it looks around and reaches out in curiosity to
everything it sees.</P>
<p>
As words are gradually acquired, the
child looks up and says &ldquo;Bow-wow&rdquo; every time it sees a
dog. It jumps up and down in its stroller, waving its arms: &ldquo;Bow-wow!
Bow-wow!&rdquo; We who are older and wiser may feel somewhat
exhausted by the child&rsquo;s enthusiasm. &ldquo;All right, all
right, it&rsquo;s a bow-wow,&rdquo; we say, unimpressed. &ldquo;Please
sit still.&rdquo; We are not enthralled. We have seen a dog before.</P>
<p>
This rapturous performance may repeat
itself hundreds of times before the child learns to pass a dog
without going crazy. Or an elephant, or a hippopotamus. But long
before the child learns to talk properly&mdash;and Ion before it
learns to think philosophically&mdash;the world we have become a
habit.</P>
<p>
A pity, if you ask me.</P>
<p>
My concern is that you do not grow up
to be one of those people who take the world for granted, Sophie
dear. So just to make sure, we are going to do a couple of
experiments in thought before we begin on the course itself.</P>
<p>
Imagine that one day you are out for a
walk in the woods. Suddenly you see a small spaceship on the path in
front of you. A tiny Martian climbs out of the spaceship and stands
on the ground looking up at you . . .</P>
<p>
What would you think? Never mind, it&rsquo;s
not important. But have you ever given any thought to the fact that
you are a Martian yourself?</P>
<p>
It is obviously unlikely that you will
ever stumble upon a creature from another planet. We do not even know
that there is life on other planets. But you might stumble upon
yourself one day. You might suddenly stop short and see yourself in a
completely new light. On just such a walk in the woods.</P>
<p>
I am an extraordinary being, you
think. I am a mysterious creature.</P>
<p>
You feel as if you are waking from an
enchanted slumber. Who am I? you ask. You know that you are
stumbling around on a planet in the universe. But what is the
universe?</P>
<p>
If you discover yourself in this
manner you will have discovered something as mysterious as the
Martian we just mentioned. You will not only have seen a being from
outer space. You will feel deep down that you are yourself an
extraordinary being.</P>
<p>
Do you follow me, Sophie? Let&rsquo;s
do another experiment in thought:</P>
<p>
One morning, Mom, Dad, and little
Thomas, aged two or three, are having breakfast in the kitchen. After
a while Mom gets up and goes over to the kitchen sink, and Dad&mdash;yes,
Dad&mdash;flies up and floats around under the ceiling while
Thomas sits watching. What do you think Thomas says? Perhaps he
points up at his father and says: &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s flying!&rdquo;
Thomas will certainly be astonished, but then he very often is. Dad
does so many strange things that this business of a little flight
over the breakfast table makes no difference to him. Every day Dad
shaves with a funny machine, sometimes he climbs onto the roof and
turns the TV aerial&mdash;or else he sticks his head under the hood
of the car and comes up black in the face.</P>
<p>
Now it&rsquo;s Mom&rsquo;s turn. She
hears what Thomas says and turns around abruptly. How do you think
she reacts to the sight of Dad floating nonchalantly over the kitchen
table?</P>
<p>
She drops the jam jar on the floor and
screams with fright. She may even need medical attention once Dad has
returned respectably to his chair. (He should have learned better
table manners by now!) Why do you think Thomas and his mother react
so differently?</P>
<p>
It all has to do with habit. (Note
this!) Mom has learned that people cannot fly. Thomas has not. He
still isn&rsquo;t certain what you can and cannot do in this
world.</P>
<p>
But what about the world itself,
Sophie? Do you think it can do what it does? The world is also
floating in space.</P>
<p>
Sadly it is not only the force of
gravity we get used to as we grow up. The world itself becomes a
habit in no time at all. It seems as if in the process of growing up
we lose the ability to wonder about the world. And in doing so, we
lose something central&mdash;something philosophers try to restore.
For somewhere inside ourselves, something tells us that life is a
huge mystery. This is something we once experienced, long before we
learned to think the thought.</P>
<p>
To be more precise: Although
philosophical questions concern us all, we do not all become
philosophers. For various reasons most people get so caught up
in everyday affairs that their astonishment at the world gets pushed
into the background. (They crawl deep into the rabbit&rsquo;s fur,
snuggle down comfortably, and stay there for the rest of their
lives.)</P>
<p>
To children, the world and everything
in it is new, something that gives rise to astonishment. It is not
like that for adults. Most adults accept the world as a matter of
course.</P>
<p>
This is precisely where philosophers
are a notable exception. A philosopher never gets quite used to
the world. To him or her, the world continues to seem a bit
unreasonable&mdash;bewildering, even enigmatic. Philosophers and
small children thus have an important faculty in common. You might
say that throughout his life a philosopher remains as
thin-skinned as a child.</P>
<p>
So now you must choose, Sophie. Are
you a child who has not yet become world-weary? Or are you a
philosopher who will vow never to become so?</P>
<p>
If you just shake your head, not
recognizing yourself as either a child or a philosopher, then you
have gotten so used to the world that it no longer astonishes you.
Watch out! You are on thin ice. And this is why you are receiving
this course in philosophy, just in case. I will not allow you, of all
people, to join the ranks of the apathetic and the indifferent. I
want you to have an inquiring mind.</P>
<p>
The whole course is free of charge, so
you get no money back if you do not complete it. If you choose to
break off the course you are free to do so. In that case you must
leave a message for me in the mailbox. A live frog would be eminently
suitable. Something green, at least, otherwise the mailman might get
scared.</P>
<p>
To summarize briefly: A white rabbit
is pulled out of a top hat. Because it is an extremely large rabbit,
the trick takes many billions of years. All mortals are born at the
very tip of the rabbit&rsquo;s fine hairs, where they are in a
position to wonder at the impossibility of the trick. But as they
grow older they work themselves ever deeper into the fur. And there
they stay. They become so comfortable they never risk crawling back
up the fragile hairs again. Only philosophers embark on this perilous
expedition to the outermost reaches of language and existence. Some
of them fall off, but others cling on desperately and yell at the
people nestling deep in the snug softness, stuffing themselves with
delicious food and drink.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo;
they yell, &ldquo;we are floating in space!&rdquo; But none of the
people down there care.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a bunch of troublemakers!&rdquo;
they say. And they keep on chatting: Would you pass the butter,
please? How much have our stocks risen today? What is the price of
tomatoes? Have you heard that Princess Di is expecting again?</P>
<p>
When Sophie&rsquo;s mother got
home later that afternoon, Sophie was practically in shock. The tin
containing the letters from the mysterious philosopher was safely
hidden in the den. Sophie had tried to start her homework but
could only sit thinking about what she had read.</P>
<p>
She had never thought so hard before! She was no longer a child&mdash;but
she wasn&rsquo;t really grown up either. Sophie realized that she had
already begun to crawl down into the cozy rabbit&rsquo;s fur, the
very same rabbit that had been pulled from the top hat of the
universe. But the philosopher had stopped her. He&mdash;or was it a
she?&mdash;had grabbed her by the back of the neck and pulled her up
again to the tip of the fur where she had played as a child. And
there, on the outermost tips of the fine hairs, she was once again
seeing the world as if for the very first time.</P>
<p>
The philosopher had rescued her. No doubt about it. The unknown
letter writer had saved her from the triviality of everyday
existence.</P>
<p>
When Mom got home at five o&rsquo;clock, Sophie dragged her into the
living room and pushed her into an armchair.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Mom&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s astonishing to be
alive?&rdquo; she began.</P>
<p>
Her mother was so surprised that she didn&rsquo;t answer at first.
Sophie was usually doing her homework when she got home.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I do&mdash;sometimes,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sometimes? Yes, but&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s
astonishing that the world exists at all?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now look, Sophie. Stop talking like that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why? Perhaps you think the world is quite normal?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t it? More or less, anyway.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie saw that the philosopher was right. Grownups took the world
for granted. They had let themselves be lulled into the enchanted
sleep of their humdrum existence once and for all.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just grown so used to the world that nothing
surprises you any more.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What on earth are you talking about?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about you getting so used to everything.
Totally dim, in other words.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I will not be spoken to like that, Sophie!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll put it another way. You&rsquo;ve made
yourself comfortable deep down in the fur of a white rabbit that
is being pulled out of the universe&rsquo;s top hat right now. And in
a minute you&rsquo;ll put the potatoes on. Then you&rsquo;ll read the
paper and after half an hour&rsquo;s nap you&rsquo;ll watch the news
on TV!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
An anxious expression came over her mother&rsquo;s face. She did
indeed go into the kitchen and put the potatoes on. After a while she
came back into the living room, and this time it was she who pushed
Sophie into an armchair.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I must talk to you about,&rdquo; she
began. Sophie could tell by her voice that it was something serious.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t gotten yourself mixed up with drugs, have
you, dear?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie was just about to laugh, but she understood why the question
was being brought up now.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you nuts?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That only makes you
duller&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
No more was said that evening about either drugs or white rabbits.</P>

<br /><H3>The Myths</h3><br />
<p>
... a precarious balance between the forces of good and evil &hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
There was no letter for Sophie the next morning. All through the
interminable day at school she was bored stiff. She took care to be
extra nice to Joanna during the breaks. On the way home they talked
about going camping as soon as the woods were dry enough.</P>
<p>
After what seemed an eternity she was once again at the mailbox.
First she opened a letter postmarked in Mexico. It was from her
father. He wrote about how much he was longing for home and how for
the first time he had managed to beat the Chief Officer at chess.
Apart from that he had almost finished the pile of books he had
brought aboard with him after his winter leave.</P>
<p>
And then, there it was&mdash;a brown envelope with her name on it!
Leaving her schoolbag and the rest of the mail in the house, Sophie
ran to the den. She pulled out the new typewritten pages and began to
read:</P>
<br /><H3>THE MYTHOLOGICAL WORLD PICTURE</h3><br />
<p>
Hello there, Sophie! We have a lot to
do, so we&rsquo;ll get started without delay.</P>
<p>
By philosophy we mean the completely
new way of thinking that evolved in Greece about six hundred years
before the birth of Christ. Until that time people had found answers
to all their questions in various religions. These religious
explanations were handed down from generation to generation in
the form of myths. A myth is a story about the gods which sets out to
explain why life is as it is.</P>
<p>
Over the millennia a wild profusion of
mythological explanations of philosophical questions spread
across the world. The Greek philosophers attempted to prove that
these explanations were not to be trusted.</P>
<p>
In order to understand how the early
philosophers thought, we have to understand what it was like to have
a mythological picture of the world. We can take some Nordic myths as
examples. (There is no need to carry coals to Newcastle.)</P>
<p>
You have probably heard of Thor and
his hammer. Before Christianity came to Norway, people believed
that Thor rode across the sky in a chariot drawn by two goats. When
he swung his hammer it made thunder and lightning. The word &ldquo;thunder&rdquo;
in Norwegian&mdash;&ldquo;Thor-d0n&rdquo;&mdash;means Thor&rsquo;s
roar. In Swedish, the word for thunder is &ldquo;aska,&rdquo;
originally &ldquo;as-aka,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;god&rsquo;s
journey&rdquo; over the heavens.</P>
<p>
When there is thunder and lightning
there is also rain, which was vital to the Viking farmers. So Thor
was worshipped as the god of fertility.</P>
<p>
The mythological explanation for rain
was therefore that Thor was swinging his hammer. And when it rained
the corn germinated and thrived in the fields.</P>
<p>
How the plants of the field could grow
and yield crops was not understood. But it was clearly somehow
connected with the rain. And since everybody believed that the
rain had something to do with Thor, he was one of the most important
of the Norse gods.</P>
<p>
There was another reason why Thor was
important, a reason related to the entire world order.</P>
<p>
The Vikings believed that the
inhabited world was an island under constant threat from outside
dangers. They called this part of the world Midgard, which means the
kingdom in the middle. Within Midgard lay Asgard, the domain of the
gods.</P>
<p>
Outside Midgard was the kingdom of
Utgard, the domain of the treacherous giants, who resorted to all
kinds of cunning tricks to try and destroy the world. Evil monsters
like these are often referred to as the &ldquo;forces of chaos.&rdquo;
Not only in Norse mythology but in almost all other cultures, people
found that there was a precarious balance between the forces of good
and evil.</P>
<p>
One of the ways in which the giants
could destroy Midgard was by abducting Freyja, the goddess of
fertility. If they could do this, nothing would grow in the fields
and the women would no longer have children. So it was vital to hold
these giants in check.</P>
<p>
Thor was a central figure in this
battle with the giants. His hammer could do more than make rain; it
was a key weapon in the struggle against the dangerous forces of
chaos. It gave him almost unlimited power. For example, he could hurl
it at the giants and slay them. And he never had to worry about
losing it because it always came back to him, just like a boomerang.</P>
<p>
This was the mythological explanation
for how the balance of nature was maintained and why there was a
constant struggle between good and evil. And this was precisely
the kind of explanation that the philosophers rejected.</P>
<p>
But it was not a question of
explanations alone.</P>
<p>
Mortals could not just sit idly by and
wait for the gods to intervene while catastrophes such as drought or
plague loomed. They had to act for themselves in the struggle against
evil. This they did by performing various religious ceremonies, or
rites.</P>
<p>
The most significant religious
ceremony in Norse times was the offering. Making an offering to a god
had the effect of increasing that god&rsquo;s power. For example,
mortals had to make offerings to the gods to give them the
strength to conquer the forces of chaos. They could do this by
sacrificing an animal to the god. The offering to Thor was usually a
goat. Offerings to Odin sometimes took the form of human sacrifices.</P>
<p>
The myth that is best known in the
Nordic countries comes from the Eddie poem &ldquo;The Lay of Thrym.&rdquo;
It tells how Thor, rising from sleep, finds that his hammer is gone.
This makes him so angry that his hands tremble and his beard shakes.
Accompanied by his henchman Loki he goes to Freyja to ask if Loki may
borrow her wings so that he can fly to Jotunheim, the land of the
giants, and find out if they are the ones who have stolen Thor&rsquo;s
hammer.</P>
<p>
At Jotunheim Loki meets Thrym, the
king of the giants, who sure enough begins to boast that he has
hidden the hammer seven leagues under the earth. And he adds that the
gods will not get the hammer back until Thrym is given Freyja as his
bride.</P>
<p>
Can you picture it, Sophie? Suddenly
the good gods find themselves in the midst of a full-blown hostage
incident. The giants have seized the gods&rsquo; most vital
defensive weapon. This is an utterly unacceptable situation. As
long as the giants have Thor&rsquo;s hammer, they have total control
over the world of gods and mortals. In exchange for the hammer they
are demanding Freyja. But this is equally unacceptable. If the gods
have to give up their goddess of fertility&mdash;she who protects all
life&mdash;the grass will disappear from the fields and all gods and
mortals will die. The situation is deadlocked.</P>
<p>
Loki returns to Asgard, so the myth
goes, and tells Freyja to put on her wedding attire for she is
(alas!) to wed the king of the giants. Freyja is furious, and says
people will think she is absolutely man-crazy if she agrees to marry
a giant.</P>
<p>
Then the god Heimdall has an idea. He
suggests that Thor dress up as a bride. With his hair up and two
stones under his tunic he will look like a woman. Understandably,
Thor is not wildly enthusiastic about the idea, but he finally
accepts that this is the only way he will ever get his hammer back.</P>
<p>
So Thor allows himself to be attired
in bridal costume, with Loki as his bridesmaid.</P>
<p>
To put it in present-day terms, Thor
and Loki are the gods&rsquo; &ldquo;anti-terrorist squad.&rdquo;
Disguised as women, their mission is to breach the giants&rsquo;
stronghold and recapture Thor&rsquo;s hammer.</P>
<p>
When the gods arrive at Jotunheim, the
giants begin to prepare the wedding feast. But during the feast, the
bride&mdash;Thor, that is&mdash;devours an entire ox and eight
salmon. He also drinks three barrels of beer. This astonishes Thrym.
The true identity of the &ldquo;commandos&rdquo; is very nearly
revealed. But Loki manages to avert the danger by explaining that
Freyja has been looking forward to coming to jotunheim so much
that she has not eaten for a week.</P>
<p>
When Thrym lifts the bridal veil to
kiss the bride, he is startled to find himself looking into Thor&rsquo;s
burning eyes. Once again Loki saves the situation by explaining that
the bride has not slept for a week because she is so excited about
the wedding. At this, Thrym commands that the hammer be brought forth
and laid in the bride&rsquo;s lap during the wedding ceremony.</P>
<p>
Thor roars with laughter when he is
given the hammer. First he kills Thrym with it, and then he wipes out
the giants and all their kin. And thus the gruesome hostage affair
has a happy ending. Thor&mdash;the Batman or James Bond of the
gods&mdash;has once again conquered the forces of evil.</P>
<p>
So much for the myth itself, Sophie.
But what is the real meaning behind it? It wasn&rsquo;t made up just
for entertainment. The myth also tries to explain something.
Here is one possible interpretation:</P>
<p>
When a drought occurred, people sought
an explanation of why there was no rain. Could it be that the
giants had stolen Thor&rsquo;s hammer?</P>
<p>
Perhaps the myth was an attempt to
explain the changing seasons of the year: in the winter Nature
dies because Thor&rsquo;s hammer is in jotunheim. But in the spring
he succeeds in winning it back. So the myth tried to give people
an explanation for something they could not understand.</P>
<p>
But a myth was not only an
explanation. People also carried out religious ceremonies related to
the myths. We can imagine how people&rsquo;s response to drought or
crop failure would be to enact a drama about the events in the myth.
Perhaps a man from the village would dress up as a bride&mdash;with
stones for breasts&mdash;in order to steal the hammer back from the
giants. By doing this, people were taking some action to make it rain
so the crops would grow in their fields.</P>
<p>
There are a great many examples from
other parts of the world of the way people dramatized their myths of
the seasons in order to speed up the processes of nature.</P>
<p>
So far we have only taken a brief
glimpse at the world of Norse mythology. But there were countless
myths about Thor and Odin, Freyr and Frey a, Hoder and Balder and
many other gods. Mythologica notions of this kind flourished all
over the world until philosophers began to tamper with them.</P>
<p>
A mythological world picture also
existed in Greece when the first philosophy was evolving. The stories
of the Greek gods had been handed down from generation to generation
for centuries. In Greece the gods were called Zeus and Apollo, Hera
and Athene, Dionysos and Ascle-pios, Heracles and Hephaestos, to
mention only a few of them.</P>
<p>
Around 700 B.C., much of the Greek
mythology was written down by Homer and Hesiod. This created a whole
new situation. Now that the myths existed in written form, it was
possible to discuss them.</P>
<p>
The earliest Greek philosophers
criticized Homer&rsquo;s mythology because the gods resembled
mortals too much and were just as egoistic and treacherous. For the
first time it was said that the myths were nothing but human notions.</P>
<p>
One exponent of this view was the
philosopher Xe-nophanes, who lived from about 570 B.C. Men have
created the gods in their own image, he said. They believe the
gods were born and have bodies and clothes and language just as we
have. Ethiopians believe that the gods are black and flat-nosed,
Thracians imagine them to be blue-eyed and fair-haired. If oxen,
horses, and lions could draw, they would depict gods that looked like
oxen, horses, and lions!</P>
<p>
During that period the Greeks founded
many city-states, both in Greece itself and in the Greek colonies in
Southern Italy and Asia Minor, where all manual work was done by
slaves, leaving the citizens free to devote all their time to
politics and culture.</P>
<p>
In these city environments people
began to think in a completely new way. Purely on his own behalf, any
citizen could question the way society ought to be organized.
Individuals could thus also ask philosophical questions without
recourse to ancient myths.</P>
<p>
We call this the development from a
mythological mode of thought to one based on experience and reason.
The aim of the early Greek philosophers was to find natural, rather
than supernatural, explanations for natural processes.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie left the den and wandered about in the large garden. She
tried to forget what she had learned at school, especially in science
classes.</P>
<p>
If she had grown up in this garden without knowing anything at all
about nature, how would she feel about the spring?</P>
<p>
Would she try to invent some kind of explanation for why it suddenly
started to rain one day? Would she work out some fantasy to explain
where the snow went and why the sun rose in the morning?</P>
<p>
Yes, she definitely would. She began to make up a story:</P>
<p>
Winter held the land in its icy grip because the evil Muriat had
imprisoned the beautiful Princess Sikita in a cold prison. But one
morning the brave Prince Bravato came and rescued her. Sikita was so
happy that she began to dance over the meadows, singing a song she
had composed inside the dank prison. The earth and the trees
were so moved that all the snow turned into tears. But then the sun
came out and dried all the tears away. The birds imitated
Sikita&rsquo;s song, and when the beautiful princess let down her
golden tresses, a few locks of her hair fell onto the earth and
turned into the lilies of the field ...</P>
<p>
Sophie liked her beautiful story. If she had not known any other
explanation for the changing seasons, she felt sure she would have
come to believe her own story in the end.</P>
<p>
She understood that people had always felt a need to explain the
processes of nature. Perhaps they could not live without such
explanations. And that they made up all those myths in the time
before there was anything called science.</P>

<br /><H3>The Natural Philosophers</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip; nothing can come from nothing &hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
When her mother got home from work that afternoon Sophie was sitting
in the glider, pondering the possible connection between the
philosophy course and Hilde Moller Knag, who would not be getting a
birthday card from her father.</P>
<p>
Her mother called from the other end of the garden, &ldquo;Sophie!
There&rsquo;s a letter for you!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She caught her breath. She had already emptied the mailbox, so the
letter had to be from the philosopher. What on earth would she say to
her mother?</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no stamp on it. It&rsquo;s probably a love
letter!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie took the letter.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to open it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She had to find an excuse.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you ever heard of anyone opening a love letter with her
mother looking over her shoulder?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Let her mother think it was a love letter. Although it was
embarrassing enough, it would be even worse if her mother found out
that she was doing a correspondence course with a complete stranger,
a philosopher who was playing hide-and-seek with her.</P>
<p>
It was one of the little white envelopes. When Sophie got upstairs to
her room, she found three new questions:</P>
<p>
<I>Is there a basic substance that everything else is made of?</I></P>
<p>
<I>Can water turn into wine? </I>
</P>
<p>
<I>How can earth and water produce a live frog!</I></P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie found the questions pretty stupid, but nevertheless they
kept buzzing around in her head all evening. She was still thinking
about them at school the next day, examining them one by one.</P>
<p>
Could there be a &ldquo;basic substance&rdquo; that everything was
made of? If there was some such substance, how could it suddenly turn
into a flower or an elephant?</P>
<p>
The same objection applied to the question of whether water could
turn into wine. Sophie knew the parable of how Jesus turned water
into wine, but she had never taken it literally. And if Jesus really
had turned water into wine, it was because it was a miracle,
something that could not be done normally. Sophie knew there was a
lot of water, not only in wine but in all other growing things. But
even if a cucumber was 95 percent water, there must be something else
in it as well, because a cucumber was a cucumber, not water.</P>
<p>
And then there was the question about the frog. Her philosophy
teacher had this really weird thing about frogs.</P>
<p>
Sophie could possibly accept that a frog consisted of earth and
water, in which case the earth must consist of more than one kind of
substance. If the earth consisted of a lot of different substances,
it was obviously possible that earth and water together could produce
a frog. That is, if the earth and the water went via frog spawn and
tadpoles. Because a frog could not just grow out of a cabbage patch,
however much you watered it.</P>
<p>
When she got home from school that day there was a fat envelope
waiting for her in the mailbox. Sophie hid in the den just as she had
done the other days.</P>
<p>

<br /><h3>THE PHILOSOPHERS&rsquo; PROJECT</h3><br />
<p>
Here we are again! We&rsquo;ll go
directly to today&rsquo;s lesson without detours around white rabbits
and the like.</P>
<p>
I&rsquo;ll outline very broadly the
way people have thought about philosophy, from the ancient Greeks
right up to our own day. But we&rsquo;ll take things in their correct
order.</P>
<p>
Since some philosophers lived in a
different age&mdash;and perhaps in a completely different culture
from ours&mdash;it is a good idea to try and see what each
philosopher&rsquo;s project is. By this I mean that we must try
to grasp precisely what it is that each particular philosopher is
especially concerned with finding out. One philosopher might want to
know how plants and animals came into being. Another might want
to know whether there is a God or whether man has an immortal soul.</P>
<p>
Once we have determined what a
particular philosopher&rsquo;s project is, it is easier to
follow his line of thought, since no one philosopher concerns himself
with the whole of philosophy.</P>
<p>
I said his line of thought&mdash;referring
to the philosopher, because this is also a story of men. Women of the
past were subjugated both as females and as thinking beings, which is
sad because a great deal of very important experience was lost
as a result. It was not until this century that women really made
their mark on the history of philosophy.</P>
<p>
I do not intend to give you any
homework&mdash;no difficult math questions, or anything like that,
and conjugating English verbs is outside my sphere of interest.
However, from time to time I&rsquo;ll give you a short assignment.</P>
<p>
If you accept these conditions, we&rsquo;ll
begin.</P>
<br /><h3>THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS</h3><br />
<p>
The earliest Greek philosophers are
sometimes called natural philosophers because they were mainly
concerned with the natural world and its processes.</P>
<p>
We have already asked ourselves where
everything comes from. Nowadays a lot of people imagine that at some
time something must have come from nothing. This idea was not so
widespread among the Greeks. For one reason or another, they assumed
that &ldquo;something&rdquo; had always existed.</P>
<p>
How everything could come from nothing
was therefore not the all-important question. On the other hand the
Greeks marveled at how live fish could come from water, and huge
trees and brilliantly colored flowers could come from the dead earth.
Not to mention how a baby could come from its mother&rsquo;s womb!</P>
<p>
The philosophers observed with their
own eyes that nature was in a constant state of transformation.
But how could such transformations occur?</P>
<p>
How could something change from being
substance to being a living thing, for example?</P>
<p>
All the earliest philosophers shared
the belief that there had to be a certain basic substance at the root
of all change. How they arrived at this idea is hard to say. We only
know that the notion gradually evolved that there must be a basic
substance that was the hidden cause of all changes in nature. There
had to be &ldquo;something&rdquo; that all things came from and
returned to.</P>
<p>
For us, the most interesting part is
actually not what solutions these earliest philosophers arrived at,
but which questions they asked and what type of answer they were
looking for. We are more interested in how they thought than in
exactly what they thought.</P>
<p>
We know that they posed questions
relating to the transformations they could observe in the
physical world. They were looking for the underlying laws of nature.
They wanted to understand what was happening around them without
having to turn to the ancient myths. And most important, they
wanted to understand the actual processes by studying nature itself.
This was quite different from explaining thunder and lightning
or winter and spring by telling stories about the gods.</P>
<p>
So philosophy gradually liberated
itself from religion. We could say that the natural philosophers took
the first step in the direction of scientific reasoning, thereby
becoming the precursors of what was to become science.</P>
<p>
Only fragments have survived of what
the natural philosophers said and wrote. What little we know is
found in the writings of Aristotle, who lived two centuries later. He
refers only to the conclusions the philosophers reached. So we do not
always know by what paths they reached these conclusions. But what we
do know enables us to establish that the earliest Greek philosophers&rsquo;
project concerned the question of a basic constituent substance and
the changes in nature.</P>
<br /><h3>THREE PHILOSOPHERS FROM MILETUS</h3><br />
<p>
The first philosopher we know of is
Thales, who came from Miletus, a Greek colony in Asia Minor. He
traveled in many countries, including Egypt, where he is said to have
calculated the height of a pyramid by measuring its shadow at the
precise moment when the length of his own shadow was equal to his
height. He is also said to have accurately predicted a solar eclipse
in the year 585 B.C.</P>
<p>
Thales thought that the source of all
things was water. We do not know exactly what he meant by that, he
may have believed that all life originated from water&mdash;and that
all life returns to water again when it dissolves.</P>
<p>
During his travels in Egypt he must
have observed how the crops began to grow as soon as the floods of
the Nile receded from the land areas in the Nile Delta. Perhaps he
also noticed that frogs and worms appeared wherever it had just been
raining.</P>
<p>
It is likely that Thales thought about
the way water turns to ice or vapor&mdash;and then turns back into
water again.</P>
<p>
Thales is also supposed to have said
that &ldquo;all things are full of gods.&rdquo; What he meant by that
we can only surmise. Perhaps, seeing how the black earth was the
source of everything from flowers and crops to insects and
cockroaches, he imagined that the earth was filled with tiny
invisible &ldquo;life-germs.&rdquo; One thing is certain&mdash;he was
not talking about Homer&rsquo;s gods.</P>
<p>
The next philosopher we hear of is
Anaximander, who also lived in Miletus at about the same time as
Thales. He thought that our world was only one of a myriad of worlds
that evolve and dissolve in something he called the boundless.
It is not so easy to explain what he meant by the boundless, but it
seems clear that he was not thinking of a known substance in the way
that Thales had envisaged. Perhaps he meant that the substance which
is the source of all things had to be something other than the things
created. Because all created things are limited, that which comes
before and after them must be &ldquo;boundless.&rdquo; It is clear
that this basic stuff could not be anything as ordinary as water.</P>
<p>
A third philosopher from Miletus was
Anaximenes (c. 570&mdash;526 B.C.). He thought that the source of all
things must be &ldquo;air&rdquo; or &ldquo;vapor.&rdquo; Anaximenes
was of course familiar with Tholes&rsquo; theory of water. But where
does water come from? Anaximenes thought that water was
condensed air. We observe that when it rains, water is pressed
from the air. When water is pressed even more, it becomes earth, he
thought. He may have seen how earth and sand were pressed out of
melting ice. He also thought that fire was rarefied air. According to
Anaximenes, air was therefore the origin of earth, water, and
fire.</P>
<p>
It is not a far cry from water to the
fruit of the earth. Perhaps Anaximenes thought that earth, air, and
fire were all necessary to the creation of life, but that the source
of all things was air or vapor. So, like Thales, he thought that
there must be an underlying substance that is the source of all
natural change.</P>
<br /><h3>Nothing Can Come from Nothing</h3><br />
<p>
These three Milesian philosophers all
believed in the existence of a single basic substance as the
source of all things. But how could one substance suddenly change
into something else? We can call this the problem of change.</P>
<p>
From about 500 B.C., there was a group
of philosophers in the Greek colony of Elea in Southern Italy.
These &ldquo;Eleatics&rdquo; were interested in this question.</P>
<p>
The most important of these
philosophers was Parmenides (c. 540-480 B.C.). Parmenides
thought that everything that exists had always existed. This
idea was not alien to the Greeks. They took it more or less for
granted that everything that existed in the world was everlasting.
Nothing can come out of nothing, thought Parmenides. And nothing that
exists can become nothing.</P>
<p>
But Parmenides took the idea further.
He thought that there was no such thing as actual change. Nothing
could become anything other than it was.</P>
<p>
Parmenides realized, of course, that
nature is in a constant state of flux. He perceived with his
senses that things changed. But he could not equate this with what
his reason told him. When forced to choose between relying
either on his senses or his reason, he chose reason.</P>
<p>
You know the expression &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
believe it when I see it.&rdquo; But Parmenides didn&rsquo;t even
believe things when he saw them. He believed that our senses give us
an incorrect picture of the world, a picture that does not tally with
our reason. As a philosopher, he saw it as his task to expose all
forms of perceptual illusion.</P>
<p>
This unshakable faith in human reason
is called rationalism. A rationalist is someone who believes
that human reason is the primary source of our knowledge of the
world.</P>
<br /><h3>All Things Flow</h3><br />
<p>
A contemporary of Parmenides was
Heraditus (c. 540-480 B.C.), who was from Ephesus in Asia Minor. He
thought that constant change, or flow, was in fact the mosf basic
characteristic of nature. We could perhaps say that Heraclitus had
more faith in what he could perceive than Parmenides did.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Everything flows,&rdquo; said
Heraclitus. Everything is in constant flux and movement, nothing is
abiding. Therefore we &ldquo;cannot step twice into the same river.&rdquo;
When I step into the river for the second time, neither I nor the
river are the same.</P>
<p>
Heraclitus pointed out that the world
is characterized by opposites. If we were never ill, we would not
know what it was to be well. If we never knew hunger, we would take
no pleasure in being full. If there were never any war, we would not
appreciate peace. And if there were no winter, we would never see the
spring.</P>
<p>
Both good and bad have their
inevitable place in the order of things, Heraclitus believed. Without
this constant interplay of opposites the world would cease to exist.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;God is day and night, winter
and summer, war and peace, hunger and satiety,&rdquo; he said. He
used the term &ldquo;God,&rdquo; but he was clearly not referring to
the gods of the mythology. To Heraclitus, God&mdash;or the Deity&mdash;was
something that embraced the whole world. Indeed, God can be seen most
clearly in the constant transformations and contrasts of nature.</P>
<p>
Instead of the term &ldquo;God,&rdquo;
Heraclitus often used the Greek word logos, meaning reason. Although
we humans do not always think alike or have the same degree of
reason, Heraclitus believed that there must be a kind of &ldquo;universal
reason&rdquo; guiding everything that happens in nature.</P>
<p>
This &ldquo;universal reason&rdquo; or
&ldquo;universal law&rdquo; is something common to us all, and
something that everybody is guided by. And yet most people live by
their individual reason, thought Heraclitus. In general, he despised
his fellow beings. &ldquo;The opinions of most people,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;are like the playthings of infants.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
So in the midst of all nature&rsquo;s
constant flux and oppo-sites, Heraclitus saw an Entity or one-ness.
This &ldquo;something,&rdquo; which was the source of
everything, he called God or logos.</P>
<br /><h3>Four Basic Elements</h3><br />
<p>
In one way, Parmenides and Heraclitus
were the direct opposite of each other. Parmenides&rsquo; reason made
it clear that nothing could change. Heraclitus&rsquo; sense
perceptions made it equally clear that nature was in a constant state
of change. Which of them was right? Should we let reason dictate
or should we rely on our senses?</P>
<p>
Parmenides and Heraclitus both say two
things:</P>
<p>
Parmenides says:</P>
<p>
a) that nothing can change, and</P>
<p>
b) that our sensory perceptions must
therefore be unreliable. Heraclitus, on the other hand, says:</P>
<p>
a) that everything changes (&ldquo;all
things flow&rdquo;), and</P>
<p>
b) that our sensory perceptions are
reliable.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
*         *         *</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Philosophers could hardly disagree
more than that! But who was right? It fell to Empedocles (c. 490-430
B.C.) from Sicily to lead the way out of the tangle they had gotten
themselves into.</P>
<p>
He thought they were both right in one
of their assertions but wrong in the other.</P>
<p>
Empedocles found that the cause of
their basic disagreement was that both philosophers had assumed
the presence of only one element. If this were true, the gap between
what reason dictates and what &ldquo;we can see with our own eyes&rdquo;
would be unbridgeable.</P>
<p>
Water obviously cannot turn into a
fish or a butterfly. In fact, water cannot change. Pure water will
continue to be pure water. So Parmenides was right in holding that
&ldquo;nothing changes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
But at the same time Empedocles agreed
with Heraclitus that we must trust the evidence of our senses. We
must believe what we see, and what we see is precisely that nature
changes.</P>
<p>
Empedocles concluded that it was the
idea of a single basic substance that had to be rejected. Neither
water nor air alone can change into a rosebush or a butterfly. The
source of nature cannot possibly be one single &ldquo;element.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Empedocles believed that all in all,
nature consisted of four elements, or &ldquo;roots&rdquo; as he
termed them. These four roots were earth, air, fire, and wafer.</P>
<p>
All natural processes were due to the
coming together and separating of these four elements. For all things
were a mixture of earth, air, fire, and water, but in varying
proportions. When a flower or an animal dies, he said, the four
elements separate again. We can register these changes with the naked
eye. But earth and air, fire and water remain everlasting,
&ldquo;untouched&rdquo; by all the compounds of which they are
part. So it is not correct to say that &ldquo;everything&rdquo;
changes. Basically, nothing changes. What happens is that the four
elements are combined and separated&mdash;only to be combined again.</P>
<p>
We can make a comparison to painting.
If a painter only has one color&mdash;red, for instance&mdash;he
cannot paint green trees. But if he has yellow, red, blue, and black,
he can paint in hundreds of different colors because he can mix them
in varying proportions.</P>
<p>
An example from the kitchen
illustrates the same thing. If I only have flour, I have to be a
wizard to bake a cake. But if I have eggs, flour, milk, and sugar,
then I can make any number of different cakes.</P>
<p>
It was not purely by chance that
Empedocles chose earth, air, fire, and water as nature&rsquo;s
&ldquo;roots.&rdquo; Other philosophers before him had tried to
show that the primordial substance had to be either water, air, or
fire. Thales and Anaximenes had pointed out that both water and air
were essential elements in the physical world. The Greeks believed
that fire was also essential. They observed, for example, the
importance of the sun to all living things, and they also knew that
both animals and humans have body heat.</P>
<p>
Empedocles might have watched a piece
of wood burning. Something disintegrates. We hear it crackle and
splutter. That is &ldquo;water.&rdquo; Something goes up in smoke.
That is &ldquo;air.&rdquo; The &ldquo;fire&rdquo; we can see.
Something also remains when the fire is extinguished. That is
the ashes&mdash;or &ldquo;earth.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
After Empedocles&rsquo; clarification
of nature&rsquo;s transformations as the combination and
dissolution of the four &ldquo;roots,&rdquo; something still remained
to be explained. What makes these elements combine so that new life
can occur? And what makes the &ldquo;mixture&rdquo; of, say, a flower
dissolve again?</P>
<p>
Empedocles believed that there were
two different forces at work in nature. He called them love and
strife. Love binds things together, and strife separates them.</P>
<p>
He distinguishes between &ldquo;substance&rdquo;
and &ldquo;force.&rdquo; This is worth noting. Even today, scientists
distinguish between elements and natural forces. Modern science
holds that all natural processes can be explained as the interaction
between different elements and various natural forces.</P>
<p>
Empedocles also raised the question of
what happens when we perceive something. How can I &ldquo;see&rdquo;
a flower, for example? What is it that happens? Have you ever thought
about it, Sophie?</P>
<p>
Empedocles believed that the eyes
consist of earth, air, fire, and water, just like everything else in
nature. So the &ldquo;earth&rdquo; in my eye perceives what is of the
earth in my surroundings, the &ldquo;air&rdquo; perceives what is of
the air, the &ldquo;fire&rdquo; perceives what is of fire, and the
&ldquo;water&rdquo; what is of water. Had my eyes lacked any of the
four substances, I would not have seen all of nature.</P>
<br /><h3>Something of Everything in
Everything</h3><br />
<p>
Anaxagoras (500-428 B.C.) was another
philosopher who could not agree that one particular basic
substance&mdash;water, for instance&mdash;might be transformed
into everything we see in the natural world. Nor could he accept
that earth, air, fire, and water can be transformed into blood and
bone.</P>
<p>
Anaxagoras held that nature is built
up of an infinite number of minute particles invisible to the eye.
Moreover, everything can be divided into even smaller parts, but even
in the minutest parts there are fragments of all other things. If
skin and bone are not a transformation of something else, there must
also be skin and bone, he thought, in the milk we drink and the food
we eat. ~~</P>
<p>
A couple of present-day examples can
perhaps illustrate Anaxagoras&rsquo; line of thinking. Modern laser
technology can produce so-called holograms. If one of these
holograms depicts a car, for example, and the hologram is
fragmented, we will see a picture of the whole car even though we
only have the part of the hologram that showed the bumper. This is
because the whole subject is present in every tiny part.</P>
<p>
In a sense, our bodies are built up in
the same way. If I loosen a skin cell from my finger, the nucleus
will contain not only the characteristics of my skin: the same cell
will also reveal what kind of eyes I have, the color of my hair, the
number and type of my fingers, and so on. Every cell of the human
body carries a blueprint of the way all the other cells are
constructed. So there is &ldquo;something of everything&rdquo; in
every single cell. The whole exists in each tiny part.</P>
<p>
Anaxagoras called these minuscule
particles which have something of everything in them seeds.</P>
<p>
Remember that Empedocles thought that
it was &ldquo;love&rdquo; that joined the elements together in whole
bodies. Anaxagoras also imagined &ldquo;order&rdquo; as a kind
of force, creating animals and humans, flowers and trees. He called
this force mind or intelligence (nous).</P>
<p>
Anaxagoras is also interesting because
he was the first philosopher we hear of in Athens. He was from Asia
Minor but he moved to Athens at the age of forty. He was later
accused of atheism and was ultimately forced to leave the city. Among
other things, he said that the sun was not a god but a red-hot stone,
bigger than the entire Peloponnesian peninsula.</P>
<p>
Anaxagoras was generally very
interested in astronomy. He believed that all heavenly bodies
were made of the same substance as Earth. He reached this conclusion
after studying a meteorite. This gave him the idea that there could
be human life on other planets. He also pointed out that the Moon has
no light of its own&mdash;its light comes from Earth, he said. He
thought up an explanation for solar eclipses as well.</P>
<p>
P.S. Thank you for your attention,
Sophie. It is not unlikely that you will need to read this
chapter two or three times before you understand it all. But
understanding will always require some effort. You probably wouldn&rsquo;t
admire a friend who was good at everything if it cost her no
effort.</P>
<p>
The best solution to the question of
basic substance and the transformations in nature must wait until
tomorrow, when you will meet Democritus. I&rsquo;ll say no more!</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie sat in the den looking out into the garden through a little
hole in the dense thicket. She had to try and sort out her thoughts
after all she had read.</P>
<p>
It was as clear as daylight that plain water could never turn into
anything other than ice or steam. Water couldn&rsquo;t even turn into
a watermelon, because even watermelons consisted of more than
just water. But she was only sure of that because that&rsquo;s what
she had learned. Would she be absolutely certain, for example, that
ice was only water if that wasn&rsquo;t what she had learned? At
least, she would have to have studied very closely how water froze to
ice and melted again.</P>
<p>
Sophie tried once again to use her own common sense, and not to think
about what she had learned from others.</P>
<p>
Parmenides had refused to accept the idea of change in any form. And
the more she thought about it, the more she was convinced that, in a
way, he had been right. His intelligence could not accept that
&ldquo;something&rdquo; could suddenly transform itself into
&ldquo;something completely different.&rdquo; It must have taken
quite a bit of courage to come right out and say it, because it meant
denying all the natural changes that people could see for themselves.
Lots of people must have laughed at him.</P>
<p>
And Empedocles must have been pretty smart too, when he proved that
the world had to consist of more than one single substance. That made
all the transformations of nature possible without anything
actually changing.</P>
<p>
The old Greek philosopher had found that out just by reasoning. Of
course he had studied nature, but he didn&rsquo;t have the equipment
to do chemical analysis the way scientists do nowadays.</P>
<p>
Sophie was not sure whether she really believed that the source of
everything actually was earth, air, fire, and water. But after all,
what did that matter? In principle, Empedocles was right. The only
way we can accept the transformations we can see with our own
eyes&mdash;without losing our reason&mdash;is to admit the existence
of more than one single basic substance.</P>
<p>
Sophie found philosophy doubly exciting because she was able to
follow all the ideas by using her own common sense&mdash;without
having to remember everything she had learned at school. She decided
that philosophy was not something you can learn; but perhaps you can
learn to think philosophically.</P>
<br /><h3>Democritus</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;the most ingenious toy in the world&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie put all the typed pages from the unknown philosopher back
into the cookie tin and put the lid on it. She crawled out of the den
and stood for a while looking across the garden. She thought about
what happened yesterday. Her mother had teased her about the &ldquo;love
letter&rdquo; again at breakfast this morning. She walked quickly
over to the mailbox to prevent the same thing from happening today.
Getting a love letter two days in a row would be doubly embarrassing.</P>
<p>
There was another little white envelope! Sophie began to discern a
pattern in the deliveries: every afternoon she would find a big brown
envelope. While she read the contents, the philosopher would sneak up
to the mailbox with another little white envelope.</P>
<p>
So now Sophie would be able to find out who he was. If it was a he!
She had a good view of the mailbox from her room. If she stood at the
window she would see the mysterious philosopher. White envelopes
don&rsquo;t just appear out of thin air!</P>
<p>
Sophie decided to keep a careful watch the following day. Tomorrow
was Friday and she would have the whole weekend ahead of her.</P>
<p>
She went up to her room and opened the envelope. There was only one
question today, but it was even dumber than the previous three:</P>
<p>
<I>Why is Lego the most ingenious toy in the world?</I></P>
<p>
For a start, Sophie was not at all sure she agreed that it was. It
was years since she had played with the little plastic blocks.
Moreover she could not for the life of her see what Lego could
possibly have to do with philosophy.</P>
<p>
But she was a dutiful student. Rummaging on the top shelf of her
closet, she found a bag full of Lego blocks of all shapes and sizes.</P>
<p>
For the first time in ages she began to build with them. As she
worked, some ideas began to occur to her about the blocks.</P>
<p>
They are easy to assemble, she thought. Even though they are all
different, they all fit together. They are also unbreakable. She
couldn&rsquo;t ever remember having seen a broken Lego block. All her
blocks looked as bright and new as the day they were bought, many
years ago. The best thing about them was that with Lego she could
construct any kind of object. And then she could separate the
blocks and construct something new.</P>
<p>
What more could one ask of a toy? Sophie decided that Lego really
could be called the most ingenious toy in the world. But what it had
to do with philosophy was beyond her.</P>
<p>
She had nearly finished constructing a big doll&rsquo;s house. Much
as she hated to admit it, she hadn&rsquo;t had as much fun in ages.</P>
<p>
Why did people quit playing when they grew up?</P>
<p>
When her mother got home and saw what Sophie had been doing, she
blurted out, &ldquo;What fun! I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re not too
grown up to play!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not playing!&rdquo; Sophie retorted indignantly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing a very complicated philosophical experiment!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother signed deeply. She was probably thinking about the white
rabbit and the top hat.</P>
<p>
When Sophie got home from school the following day, there were
several more pages for her in a big brown envelope. She took them
upstairs to her room. She could not wait to read them, but she had to
keep her eye on the mailbox at the same time.</P>
<br /><h3>THE ATOM THEORY</h3><br />
<p>
Here I am again, Sophie. Today you are
going to hear about the last of the great natural philosophers. His
name is Democritus (c. 460-370 B.C.) and he was from the little town
of Abdera on the northern Aegean coast.</P>
<p>
If you were able to answer the
question about Lego blocks without difficulty, you should have no
problem understanding what this philosopher&rsquo;s project was.</P>
<p>
Democritus agreed with his
predecessors that transformations in nature could not be due to
the fact that anything actually &ldquo;changed.&rdquo; He
therefore assumed that everything was built up of tiny invisible
blocks, each of which was eternal and immutable. Democritus called
these smallest units atoms.</P>
<p>
The word &ldquo;a-tom&rdquo; means
&ldquo;un-cuttable.&rdquo; For Democritus it was all-important to
establish that the constituent parts that everything else was
composed of could not be divided indefinitely into smaller
parts. If this were possible, they could not be used as blocks. If
atoms could eternally be broken down into ever smaller parts, nature
would begin to dissolve like constantly diluted soup.</P>
<p>
Moreover, nature&rsquo;s blocks had to
be eternal&mdash;because nothing can come from nothing. In this, he
agreed with Parmenides and the Eleatics. Also, he believed that all
atoms were firm and solid. But they could not all be the same. If all
atoms were identical, there would still be no satisfactory
explanation of how they could combine to form everything from poppies
and olive trees to goatskin and human hair.</P>
<p>
Democritus believed that nature
consisted of an unlimited number and variety of atoms. Some were
round and smooth, others were irregular and jagged. And precisely
because they were so different they could join together into all
kinds of different bodies. But however infinite they might be in
number and shape, they were all eternal, immutable, and
indivisible.</P>
<p>
When a body&mdash;a tree or an animal,
for instance&mdash;died and disintegrated, the atoms dispersed and
could be used again in new bodies. Atoms moved around in space, but
because they had &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; and &ldquo;barbs,&rdquo; they
could join together to form all the things we see around us.</P>
<p>
So now you see what I meant about Lego
blocks. They have more or less the same properties as those which
Democritus ascribed to atoms. And that is what makes them so much fun
to build with. They are first and foremost indivisible. Then they
have different shapes and sizes. They are solid and impermeable. They
also have &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; and &ldquo;barbs&rdquo; so that they
can be connected to form every conceivable figure. These connections
can later be broken again so that new figures can be constructed from
the same blocks.</P>
<p>
The fact that they can be used over
and over is what has made Lego so popular. Each single Lego block can
be part of a truck one day and part of a castle the day after. We
could also say that lego blocks are &ldquo;eternal.&rdquo; Children
of today can play with the same blocks their parents played with when
they were little.</P>
<p>
We can form things out of clay too,
but clay cannot be used over and over, because it can be broken up
into smaller and smaller pieces. These tiny pieces can never be
joined together again to make something else.</P>
<p>
Today we can establish that
Democritus&rsquo; atom theory was more or less correct. Nature really
is built up of different &ldquo;atoms&rdquo; that join and
separate again. A hydrogen atom in a cell at the end of my nose was
once part of an elephant&rsquo;s trunk. A carbon atom in my cardiac
muscle was once in the tail of a dinosaur.</P>
<p>
In our own time, however, scientists
have discovered that atoms can be broken into smaller &ldquo;elemental
particles.&rdquo; We call these elemental particles protons,
neutrons, and electrons. These will possibly some day be broken into
even lesser particles. But physicists agree that somewhere along the
line there has to be a limit. There has to be a &ldquo;minimal part&rdquo;
of which nature consists.</P>
<p>
Democritus did not have access to
modern electronic apparatus. His only proper equipment was his mind.
But reason left him no real choice. Once it is accepted that nothing
can change, that nothing can come out of nothing, and that
nothing is ever lost, then nature must consist of infinitesimal
blocks that can join and separate again.</P>
<p>
Democritus did not believe in any
&ldquo;force&rdquo; or &ldquo;soul&rdquo; that could intervene in
natural processes. The only things that existed, he believed, were
atoms and the void. Since he believed in nothing but material things,
we call him a materialist.</P>
<p>
According to Democritus, there is no
conscious &ldquo;design&rdquo; in the movement of atoms. In
nature, everything happens quite mechanically. This does not mean
that everything happens randomly, for everything obeys the inevitable
laws of necessity. Everything that happens has a natural cause, a
cause that is inherent in the thing itself. Democritus once said that
he would rather discover a new cause of nature than be the King of
Persia.</P>
<p>
The atom theory also explains our
sense perception, thought Democritus. When we sense something, it is
due to the movement of atoms in space. When I see the moon, it is
because &ldquo;moon atoms&rdquo; penetrate my eye.</P>
<p>
But what about the &ldquo;soul,&rdquo;
then? Surely that could not consist of atoms, of material things?
Indeed it could. Democritus believed that the soul was made up
of special round, smooth &ldquo;soul atoms.&rdquo; When a human being
died, the soul atoms flew in all directions, and could then become
part of a new soul formation.</P>
<p>
This meant that human beings had no
immortal soul, another belief that many people share today. They
believe, like Democritus, that &ldquo;soul&rdquo; is connected
with brain, and that we cannot have any form of consciousness once
the brain disintegrates.</P>
<p>
Democritus&rsquo;s atom theory marked
the end of Greek natural philosophy for the time being. He
agreed with ,Her-aclitus that everything in nature &ldquo;flowed,&rdquo;
since Torms come and go. But behind everything that flowed there were
some eternal and immutable things that did not flow. Democritus
called them atoms.</P>
<p>
During her reading Sophie glanced
out of the window several times to see whether her mysterious
correspondent had turned up at the mailbox. Now she just sat
staring down the road, thinking about what she had read. She felt
that Democritus&rsquo;s ideas had been so simple and yet so
ingenious. He had discovered the real solution to the problem of
&ldquo;basic substance&rdquo; and &ldquo;transformation.&rdquo; This
problem had been so complicated that philosophers had gone
around puzzling over it for generations. And in the end Democritus
had solved it on his own by using his common sense.</P>
<p>
Sophie could hardly help smiling. It had to be true that nature was
built up of small parts that never changed. At the same time
Heraclitus was obviously right in thinking that all forms in nature
&ldquo;flow.&rdquo; Because everybody dies, animals die, even a
mountain range slowly disintegrates. The point was that the mountain
range is made up of tiny indivisible parts that never break up.</P>
<p>
At the same time Democritus had raised some new questions. For
example, he had said that everything happened mechanically. He
did not accept that there was any spiritual force in life&mdash;unlike
Empedocles and An-axagoras. Democritus also believed that man had no
immortal soul.</P>
<p>
Could she be sure of that?</P>
<p>
She didn&rsquo;t know. But then she had only just begun the
philosophy course.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<br /><h3>Fate</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip; the &ldquo;fortune-teller&rdquo; is trying to foresee
something that is really quite unforeseeable ...</P>
<p>
Sophie had been keeping her eye on the mailbox while she read about
Democritus. But just in case, she decided nevertheless to take a
stroll down to the garden gate.</P>
<p>
When she opened the front door she saw a small envelope on the
front step. And sure enough&mdash;it was addressed to Sophie
Amundsen.</P>
<p>
So he had tricked her! Today of all days, when she had kept such
careful watch on the mailbox, the mystery man had sneaked up to the
house from a different angle and just laid the letter on the step
before making off into the woods again. Drat!</P>
<p>
How did he know that Sophie was watching the mailbox today? Had
he seen her at the window? Anyway, she was glad to find the letter
before her mother arrived.</P>
<p>
Sophie went back to her room and opened the letter. The white
envelope was a bit wet around the edges, and had two little holes in
it. Why was that? It had not rained for several days.</P>
<p>
The little note inside read:</P>
<p>
<I>Do you believe in Fate?</I></P>
<p>
<I>Is sickness the punishment of the gods?</I></P>
<p>
<I>What forces govern the course of history?</I></P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Did she believe in Fate? She was not at all sure. But she knew a lot
of people who did. There was a girl in her class who read horoscopes
in magazines. But if they believed in astrology, they probably
believed in Fate as well, because astrologers claimed that the
position of the stars influenced people&rsquo;s lives on Earth.</P>
<p>
If you believed that a black cat crossing your path meant bad
luck&mdash;well, then you believed in Fate, didn&rsquo;t you? As she
thought about it, several more examples of fatalism occurred to her.
Why do so many people knock on wood, for example? And why was Friday
the thirteenth an unlucky day? Sophie had heard that lots of
hotels had no room number 13. It had to be because so many people
were superstitious.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Superstitious.&rdquo; What a strange word. If you believed
in Christianity or Islam, it was called &ldquo;faith.&rdquo; But if
you believed in astrology or Friday the thirteenth it was
superstition! Who had the right to call other people&rsquo;s
belief superstition?</P>
<p>
Sophie was sure of one thing, though. Democritus had not believed in
fate. He was a materialist. He had only believed in atoms and empty
space.</P>
<p>
Sophie tried to think about the other questions on the note.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is sickness the punishment of the gods?&rdquo; Surely nobody
believed that nowadays? But it occurred to her that many people
thought it helped to pray for recovery, so at any rate they must
believe that God had some power over people&rsquo;s health.</P>
<p>
The last question was harder to answer. Sophie had never given much
thought to what governed the course of history. It had to be people,
surely? If it was God or Fate, people had no free will.</P>
<p>
The idea of free will made Sophie think of something else. Why should
she put up with this mysterious philosopher playing cat and
mouse with her? Why couldn&rsquo;t she write a letter to him. He (or
she) would quite probably put another big envelope in the
mailbox during the night or sometime tomorrow morning. She would see
to it that there was a letter ready for this person.</P>
<p>
Sophie began right away. It was difficult to write to someone she had
never seen. She didn&rsquo;t even know if it was a man or a woman. Or
if he or she was old or young. For that matter, the mysterious
philosopher could even be someone she already knew. She wrote:</P>
<p>
Most respected philosopher, Your generous correspondence course
in philosophy is greatly appreciated by us here. But it bothers
us not to know who you are. We therefore request you to use your full
name. In return we would like to extend our hospitality should
you care to corne and have coffee with us, but preferably when my
mother is at home. She is at work from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day
from Monday to Friday. I am at school during these days, but I am
always home by 2:15 p.m., except on Thursdays. I am also very good at
making coffee.</P>
<p>
Thanking you in advance, I remain</P>
<p>
Your attentive student,</P>
<p>
Sophie Amundsen (aged 14)</P>
<p>
At the bottom of the page she wrote RSVP.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie felt that the letter had turned out much too formal. But it
was hard to know which words to choose when writing to a person
without a face. She put the letter in a pink envelope and addressed
it &ldquo;To the philosopher.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The problem was where to put it so her mother didn&rsquo;t find it.
She would have to wait for her to get home before putting it in the
mailbox. And she would also have to remember to look in the mailbox
early the next morning before the newspaper arrived. If no new letter
came for her this evening or during the night, she would have to take
the pink envelope in again.</P>
<p>
Why did it all have to be so complicated?</P>
<p>
That evening Sophie went up to her room early, even though it was
Friday. Her mother tried to tempt her with pizza and a thriller on
TV, but Sophie said she was tired and wanted to go to bed and read.
While her mother sat watching TV, she sneaked out to the mailbox with
her letter.</P>
<p>
Her mother was clearly worried. She had started speaking to Sophie in
a different tone since the business with the white rabbit and the top
hat. Sophie hated to be a worry to her mother, but she just had to go
upstairs and keep an eye on the mailbox.</P>
<p>
When her mother came up at about eleven o&rsquo;clock, Sophie was
sitting at the window staring down the road.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not still sitting there staring at the mailbox!&rdquo;
she said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can look at whatever I like.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I really think you must be in love, Sophie. But if he is going
to bring you another letter, he certainly won&rsquo;t come in the
middle of the night.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Yuck! Sophie loathed all that soppy talk about love. But she had to
let her mother go on believing it was true.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is he the one who told you about the rabbit and the top hat?&rdquo;
her mother asked.</P>
<p>
Sophie nodded.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t do drugs, does he?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Now Sophie felt really sorry for her mother. She couldn&rsquo;t go on
letting her worry this way, although it was completely nutty of her
to think that just because someone had a slightly bizarre idea he
must be on something. Grownups really were idiotic sometimes.</P>
<p>
She said, &ldquo;Mom, I promise you once and for all I&rsquo;ll never
do any of that stuff... and he doesn&rsquo;t either. But he is very
interested in philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is he older than you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie shook her head.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The same age?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie nodded.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s very sweet, darling. Now I
think you should try and get some sleep.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
But Sophie stayed sitting by the window for what seemed like hours.
At last she could hardly keep her eyes open. It was one o&rsquo;clock.</P>
<p>
She was just about to go to bed when she suddenly caught sight of a
shadow emerging from the woods.</P>
<p>
Although it was almost dark outside, she could make out the shape of
a human figure. It was a man, and Sophie thought he looked quite old.
He was certainly not her age! He was wearing a beret of some kind.</P>
<p>
She could have sworn he glanced up at the house, but Sophie&rsquo;s
light was not on. The man went straight up to the mailbox and dropped
a big envelope into it. As he let go of it, he caught sight of
Sophie&rsquo;s letter. He reached down into the mailbox and fished it
up. The next minute he was walking swiftly back toward the woods. He
hurried down the woodland path and was gone.</P>
<p>
Sophie felt her heart pounding. Her first instinct was to run after
him in her pajamas but she didn&rsquo;t dare run after a stranger in
the middle of the night. But she did have to go out and fetch the
envelope.</P>
<p>
After a minute or two she crept down the stairs, opened the front
door quietly, and ran to the mailbox. In a flash she was back in her
room with the envelope in her hand. She sat on her bed, holding her
breath. After a few minutes had passed and all was still quiet in the
house, she opened the letter and began to read.</P>
<p>
She knew this would not be an answer to her own letter. That could
not arrive until tomorrow.</P>
<br /><h3>FATE</h3><br />
<p>
Good morning once again, my dear
Sophie. In case you should get any ideas, let me make it quite clear
that you must never attempt to check up on me. One day we will meet,
but I shall be the one to decide when and where. And that&rsquo;s
final. You are not going to disobey me, are you?</P>
<p>
But to return to the philosophers. We
have seen how they tried to find natural explanations for the
transformations in Nature. Previously these things had been
explained through myths.</P>
<p>
Old superstitions had to be cleared
away in other areas as well. We see them at work in matters of
sickness and health as well as in political events. In both these
areas the Greeks were great believers in fatalism.</P>
<p>
Fatalism is the belief that whatever
happens is predestined. We find this belief all over the world,
not only throughout history but in our own day as welt. Here in the
Nordic countries we find a strong belief in &ldquo;lagnadan,&rdquo;
or fate, in the old Icelandic sagas of the Edda.</P>
<p>
We also find the belief, both in
Ancient Greece and in other parts of the world, that people could
learn their fate from some form of oracle. In other words, that the
fate of a person or a country could be foreseen in various ways.</P>
<p>
There are still a lot of people who
believe that they can tell your fortune in the cards, read your palm,
or predict your future in the stars.</P>
<p>
A special Norwegian version of this is
telling your fortune in coffee cups. When a coffee cup is empty
there are usually some traces of coffee grounds left. These might
form a certain image or pattern&mdash;at least, if we give our
imagination free rein. If the grounds resemble a car, it might mean
that the person who drank from the cup is going for a long drive.</P>
<p>
Thus the &ldquo;fortune-teller&rdquo;
is trying to foresee something that is really quite unforeseeable.
This is characteristic of all forms of foreseeing. And precisely
because what they &ldquo;see&rdquo; is so vague, it is hard to
repudiate fortune-tellers&rsquo; claims.</P>
<p>
When we gaze up at the stars, we see a
veritable chaos of twinkling dots. Nevertheless, throughout the ages
there have always been people who believed that the stars could tell
us something about our life on Earth. Even today there are political
leaders who seek the advice of astrologers before they make any
important decisions.</P>
<br /><h3>The Oracle at Delphi</h3><br />
<p>
The ancient Greeks believed that they
could consult the famous oracle at Delphi about their fate. Apollo,
the god of the oracle, spoke through his priestess Pythia, who sat on
a stool over a fissure in the earth, from which arose hypnotic vapors
that put Pythia in a trance. This enabled her to be Apollo&rsquo;s
mouthpiece. When people came to Delphi they had to present their
question to the priests of the oracle, who passed it on to Pythia.
Her answer would be so obscure or ambiguous that the priests would
have to interpret it. In that way, the ieople got the benefit of
Apollo&rsquo;s wisdom, believing that e knew everything, even about
the future.</P>
<p>
There were many heads of state who
dared not go to war or take other decisive steps until they had
consulted the oracle at Delphi. The priests of Apollo thus functioned
more or less as diplomats, or advisers. They were experts with an
intimate knowledge of the people and the country.</P>
<p>
Over the entrance to the temple at
Delphi was a famous inscription: KNOW THYSELF! It reminded visitors
that man must never believe himself to be more than mortal&mdash;and
that no man can escape his destiny.</P>
<p>
The Greeks had many stories of people
whose destiny catches up with them. As time went by, a number of
plays&mdash;tragedies&mdash;were written about these &ldquo;tragic&rdquo;
people. The most famous one is the tragedy of King Oedipus.</P>
<br /><h3>History and Medicine</h3><br />
<p>
But Fate did not just govern the lives
of individuals. The Greeks believed that even world history was
governed by Fate, and that the fortunes of war could be swayed by the
intervention of the gods. Today there are still many people who
believe that God or some other mysterious power is steering the
course of history.</P>
<p>
But at the same time as Greek
philosophers were trying to find natural explanations for the
processes of nature, the first historians were beginning to search
for natural explanations for the course of history. When a country
lost a war, the vengeance of the gods was no longer an acceptable
explanation to them. The best known Greek historians were
Herodotus (484-424 B.C.) and Thucydides (460-400 B.C.).</P>
<p>
The Greeks also believed that sickness
could be ascribed to divine intervention. On the other hand, the
gods could make people well again if they made the appropriate
sacrifices.</P>
<p>
This idea was in no way unique to the
Greeks. Before the development of modern medicine, the most widely
accepted view was that sickness was due to supernatural causes.
The word &ldquo;influenza&rdquo; actually means a malign influence
from the stars.</P>
<p>
Even today, there are a lot of people
who believe that some diseases&mdash;AIDS, for example&mdash;are
God&rsquo;s punishment. Many also believe that sick people can
be cured with the help of the supernatural.</P>
<p>
Concurrently with the new directions
in Greek philosophy, a Greek medical science arose which tried
to find natural explanations for sickness and health. The founder of
Greek medicine is said to have been Hippocrates, who was born on the
island of Cos around 460 B.C.</P>
<p>
The most essential safeguards against
sickness, according to the Hippocratic medical tradition, were
moderation and a healthy lifestyle. Health is the natural condition.
When sickness occurs, it is a sign that Nature has gone off course
because of physical or mental imbalance. The road to health for
everyone is through moderation, harmony, and a &ldquo;sound mind
in a sound body.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
There is a lot of talk today about
&ldquo;medical ethics,&rdquo; which is another way of saying that a
doctor must practice medicine according to certain ethical rules. For
instance, a doctor may not give healthy people a prescription for
narcotics. A doctor must also maintain professional secrecy,
which means that he is not allowed to reveal anything a patient
has told him about his illness. These ideas go back to Hippocrates.
He required his pupils to take the following oath:</P>
<p>
I will follow that system or regimen
which, according to my ability and judgment, I consider to be
for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever is
deleterious and mischievous. 1 will give no deadly medicine to anyone
if asked nor suggest any such counsel, and in like manner I will not
give to a woman the means to produce an abortion. Whenever I go
into a house, I will go for the benefit of the sick and will abstain
from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption, and
further, from the seduction of females or males, whether freemen or
slaves.</P>
<p>
Whatever, in connection with my
professional practice, I see or hear which ought not to be
spoken abroad, I will keep secret. So long as I continue to carry out
this oath unviolated, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and the
practice of the art, respected by all men in all times, but should I
violate this oath, may the reverse be my lot.</P>
<p>
Sophie awoke with a start on
Saturday morning. Was it a dream or had she really seen the
philosopher?</P>
<p>
She felt under the bed with one hand. Yes&mdash;there lay the letter
that had come during the night. It wasn&rsquo;t only a dream.</P>
<p>
She had definitely seen the philosopher! And what&rsquo;s more, with
her own eyes she had seen him take her letter!</P>
<p>
She crouched down on the floor and pulled out all the typewritten
pages from under the bed. But what was that? Right by the wall there
was something red. A scarf, perhaps?</P>
<p>
Sophie edged herself in under the bed and pulled out a red silk
scarf. It wasn&rsquo;t hers, that was for sure!</P>
<p>
She examined it more closely and gasped when she saw HILDE written in
ink along the seam.</P>
<p>
Hilde! But who was Hilde? How could their paths keep crossing like
this?</P>
<br /><h3>Socrates</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;wisest is she who knows she does not know&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie put on a summer dress and hurried down to the kitchen. Her
mother was standing by the kitchen table. Sophie decided not to say
anything about the silk scarf.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you bring in the newspaper?&rdquo; she asked.</P>
<p>
Her mother turned.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you get it for me?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie was out of the door in a flash, down the gravel path to the
mailbox.</P>
<p>
Only the newspaper. She couldn&rsquo;t expect an answer so soon, she
supposed. On the front page of the paper she read something about the
Norwegian UN battalion in Lebanon.</P>
<p>
The UN battalion ... wasn&rsquo;t that the postmark on the card from
Hilde&rsquo;s father? But the postage stamp had been Norwegian. Maybe
the Norwegian UN soldiers had their own post office with them.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become very interested in the newspaper,&rdquo;
said her mother drily when Sophie returned to the kitchen.</P>
<p>
Luckily her mother said no more about mailboxes and stuff, either
during breakfast or later on that day. When she went shopping, Sophie
took her letter about Fate down to the den.</P>
<p>
She was surprised to see a little white envelope beside the cookie
tin with the other letters from the philosopher. Sophie was quite
sure she had not put it there.</P>
<p>
This envelope was also wet around the edges. And it had a couple of
deep holes in it, just like the one she had received yesterday.</P>
<p>
Had the philosopher been here? Did he know about her secret hiding
place? Why was the envelope wet?</P>
<p>
All these questions made her head spin. She opened the letter and
read the note:</P>
<p>
Dear Sophie, I read your letter with great interest&mdash; and not
without some regret. I must unfortunately disappoint you with regard
to the invitation. We shall meet one day, but it will probably be
quite a while before I can come in person to Captain&rsquo;s Bend.</P>
<p>
I must add that from now on I will no longer be able to deliver the
letters personally. It would be much too risky in the long run. In
the future, letters will be delivered by my little messenger. On the
other hand, they will be brought directly to the secret place in
the garden.</P>
<p>
You may continue to contact me whenever you feel the need. When you
do, put a pink envelope out with a cookie or a lump of sugar in it.
When the messenger finds it, he will bring it straight to me.</P>
<p>
P.S. It is not pleasant to decline a young lady&rsquo;s invitation to
coffee, but sometimes it is a matter of necessity.</P>
<p>
P.P.S. If you should come across a red silk scarf anywhere, please
take care of it. Sometimes personal property gets mixed up.
Especially at school and places like that, and this is a philosophy
school.</P>
<p>
Yours, Alberto Knox</P>
<p>
Sophie had lived for almost fifteen years, and had received
quite a lot of letters in her young life, at least at Christmas and
on birthdays. But this letter was the strangest one she had ever
received.</P>
<p>
It had no postage stamp. It hadn&rsquo;t even been put in the
mailbox. It had been brought straight to Sophie&rsquo;s top-secret
hideout in the old hedge. The fact that it was wet in the dry spring
weather was also most mystifying.</P>
<p>
The strangest thing of all was the silk scarf, of course. The
philosopher must have another pupil. That was it. And this other
pupil had lost a red silk scarf. Right. But how had she managed to
lose it under Sophie&rsquo;s bed?</P>
<p>
And Alberto Knox &hellip; what kind of a name was that?</P>
<p>
One thing was confirmed&mdash;the connection between the philosopher
and Hilde Moller Knag. But that Hilde&rsquo;s own father was now
confusing their addresses&mdash;that was completely incomprehensible.</P>
<p>
Sophie sat for a long time thinking about what connection there
could possibly be between Hilde and herself. Finally she gave
up. The philosopher had written that she would meet him one day.
Perhaps she would meet Hilde too.</P>
<p>
She turned the letter over. She now saw that there were some
sentences written on the back as well:</P>
<p>
<I>Is there such a thing as natural modesty? </I>
</P>
<p>
<I>Wisest is she who knows she does not know... </I>
</P>
<p>
<I>True insight comes from within. </I>
</P>
<p>
<I>He who knows what is right will do right.</I></P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie knew that the short sentences that came in the white envelopes
were intended to prepare her for the next big envelope, which would
arrive shortly thereafter. She suddenly had an idea. If the
&ldquo;messenger&rdquo; came to the den to deliver a brown envelope,
Sophie could simply sit and wait for him. Or was it a her? She
would definitely hang on to whoever it was until he or she told her
more about the philosopher! The letter said that the &ldquo;messenger&rdquo;
was little. Could it be a child? &ldquo;Is there such a thing as
natural modesty?&rdquo; Sophie knew that &ldquo;modesty&rdquo; was an
old-fashioned word for shyness&mdash;for example, about being seen
naked. But was it really natural to be embarrassed about that? If
something was natural, she supposed, it was the same for everybody.
In many parts of the world it was completely natural to be
naked. So it must be society that decides what you can and can&rsquo;t
do. When Grandma was young you certainly couldn&rsquo;t sunbathe
topless. But today, most people think it is &ldquo;natural,&rdquo;
even though it is still strictly forbidden in lots of countries. Was
this philosophy? Sophie wondered.</P>
<p>
The next sentence was: &ldquo;Wisest is she who knows she does not
know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Wiser than who? If the philosopher meant that someone who
realized that she didn&rsquo;t know everything under the sun was
wiser than someone who knew just a little, but who thought she knew a
whole lot&mdash;well, that wasn&rsquo;t so difficult to agree with.
Sophie had never thought about it before. But the more she did, the
more clearly she saw that knowing what you don&rsquo;t know is also a
kind of knowledge. The stupidest thing she knew was for people to act
like they knew all about things they knew absolutely nothing about.</P>
<p>
The next sentence was about true insight coming from within. But
didn&rsquo;t all knowledge come into people&rsquo;s heads from the
outside? On the other hand, Sophie could remember situations when her
mother or the teachers at school had tried to teach her something
that she hadn&rsquo;t been receptive to. And whenever she had really
learned something, it was when she had somehow contributed to it
herself. Now and then, even, she would suddenly understand a thing
she&rsquo;d drawn a total blank on before. That was probably what
people meant by &ldquo;insight.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
So far, so good. Sophie thought she had done reasonably well on
the first three questions. But the next statement was so odd she
couldn&rsquo;t help smiling: &ldquo;He who knows what is right will
do right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Did that mean that when a bank robber robbed a bank it was because he
didn&rsquo;t know any better? Sophie didn&rsquo;t think so.</P>
<p>
On the contrary, she thought that both children and adults did stupid
things that they probably regretted afterwards, precisely
because they had done them against their better judgment.</P>
<p>
While she sat thinking, she heard something rustling in the dry
undergrowth on the other side of the hedge nearest the woods. Could
it be the messenger? Her heart started beating faster. It sounded
like a panting animal was coming.</P>
<p>
The next moment a big Labrador pushed its way into the den.</P>
<p>
In its mouth it held a big brown envelope which it dropped at
Sophie&rsquo;s feet. It all happened so quickly that Sophie had no
time to react. A second later she was sitting with the big envelope
in her hands&mdash;and the golden Labrador had scampered off into the
woods again.</P>
<p>
Once it was all over she reacted. She started to cry.</P>
<p>
She sat like that for a while, losing all sense of time.</P>
<p>
Then she looked up suddenly.</P>
<p>
So that was his famous messenger! Sophie breathed a sigh of relief.
Of course that was why the white envelopes were wet around the
edges and had holes in them. Why hadn&rsquo;t she thought of it? Now
it made sense to put a cookie or a lump of sugar in the envelope when
she wrote to the philosopher.</P>
<p>
She may not always have been as smart as she would like, but who
could have guessed that the messenger was a trained dog! It was a bit
out of the ordinary, to put it mildly! She could certainly forget all
about forcing the messenger to reveal Alberto Knox&rsquo;s
whereabouts.</P>
<p>
Sophie opened the big envelope and began to read.</P>
<br /><h3>THE PHILOSOPHY OF ATHENS</h3><br />
<p>
Dear Sophie, When you read this you
may already have met Hermes. In case you haven&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll
add that he is a dog. But don&rsquo;t worry. He is very
good-tempered&mdash;and moreover, a good deal more intelligent
than a lot of people. In any event he never tries to give the
impression of being cleverer than he is.</P>
<p>
You may also note that his name is not
without significance.</P>
<p>
In Greek mythology, Hermes was the
messenger of the gods. He was also the god of seafarers, but we shall
not bother about that, at least not for the moment. It is more
important that Hermes also gave his name to the word &ldquo;hermetic,&rdquo;
which means hidden or inaccessible&mdash;not inappropriate for
the way Hermes takes care to keep the two of us hidden from each
other.</P>
<p>
So the messenger has herewith been
introduced. Naturally he answers to his name and is altogether
very well behaved.</P>
<p>
But to return to philosophy. We have
already completed the first part of the course. I refer to the
natural philosophers and their decisive break with the mythological
world picture. Now we are going to meet the three great classical
philosophers, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Each in his own
way, these philosophers influenced the whole of European
civilization.</P>
<p>
The natural philosophers are also
called the pre-Socratics, because they lived before Socrates.
Although Democritus died some years after Socrates, all his ideas
belong to pre-Socratic natural philosophy. Socrates represents a
new era, geographically as well as temporally. He was the first of
the great philosophers to be born in Athens, and both he and his two
successors lived and worked there. You may recall that Anaxagoras
also lived in Athens for a while but was hounded out because he said
the sun was a red-hot stone. (Socrates fared no better!)</P>
<p>
From the time of Socrates, Athens was
the center of Greek culture. It is also important to note the change
of character in the philosophical project itself as it progresses
from natural philosophy to Socrates. But before we meet Socrates, let
us hear a little about the so-called Sophists, who dominated the
Athenian scene at the time of Socrates.</P>
<p>
Curtain up, Sophie! The history of
ideas is like a drama in many acts.</P>
<br /><h3>Man at the Center</h3><br />
<p>
After about 450 B.C., Athens was the
cultural center of the Greek world. From this time on, philosophy
took a new direction. The natural philosophers had been mainly
concerned with the nature of the physical world. This gives them a
central position in the history of science. In Athens, interest was
now focused on the individual and the individual&rsquo;s place in
society. Gradually a democracy evolved, with popular assemblies and
courts of law.</P>
<p>
In order for democracy to work, people
had to be educated enough to take part in the democratic
process. We have seen in our own time how a young democracy needs
popular enlightenment. For the Athenians, it was first and foremost
essential to master the art of rhetoric, which means saying things in
a convincing manner.</P>
<p>
A group of itinerant teachers and
philosophers from the Greek colonies flocked to Athens. They called
themselves Sophists. The word &ldquo;sophist&rdquo; means a wise and
informed person. In Athens, the Sophists made a living out of
teaching the citizens for money.</P>
<p>
The Sophists had one characteristic in
common with the natural philosophers: they were critical of the
traditional mythology. But at the same time the Sophists rejected
what they regarded as fruitless philosophical speculation. Their
opinion was that although answers to philosophical questions may
exist, man cannot know the truth about the riddles of nature and
of the universe. In philosophy a view like this is called skepticism.</P>
<p>
But even if we cannot know the answers
to all of nature&rsquo;s riddles, we know that people have to learn
to live together. The Sophists chose to concern themselves with man
and his place in society.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Man is the measure of all
things,&rdquo; said the Sophist Protagoras (c. 485-410 B.C.). By that
he meant that the question of whether a thing is right or wrong, good
or bad, must always be considered in relation to a person&rsquo;s
needs. On being asked whether he believed in the Greek gods, he
answered, &ldquo;The question is complex and life is short.&rdquo; A
person who is unable to say categorically whether or not the gods or
God exists is called an agnostic.</P>
<p>
The Sophists were as a rule men who
had traveled widely and seen different forms of government. Both
conventions and local laws in the city-states could vary widely.
This led the Sophists to raise the question of what was natural and
what was socially induced. By doing this, they paved the way for
social criticism in the city-state of Athens.</P>
<p>
They could for example point out that
the use of an expression like &ldquo;natural modesty&rdquo; is not
always defensible, for if it is &ldquo;natural&rdquo; to be
modest, it must be something you are born with, something innate. But
is it really innate, Sophie&mdash;or is it socially induced? To
someone who has traveled the world, the answer should be simple: It
is not &ldquo;natural&rdquo;&mdash;or innate&mdash;to be afraid to
show yourself naked. Modesty&mdash;or the lack of it&mdash;is
first and foremost a matter of social convention.</P>
<p>
As you can imagine, the wandering
Sophists created bitter wrangling in Athens by pointing out that
there were no absolute norms for what was right or wrong.</P>
<p>
Socrates, on the other hand, tried to
show that some such norms are in fact absolute and universally valid.</P>
<br /><h3>Who Was Socrates?</h3><br />
<p>
Socrates (470-399 B.C.) is possibly
the most enigmatic figure in the entire history of philosophy. He
never wrote a single line. Yet he is one of the philosophers who has
had the greatest influence on European thought, not least because of
the dramatic manner of his death.</P>
<p>
We know he was born in Athens, and
that he spent most of his life in the city squares and marketplaces
talking with the people he met there. &ldquo;The trees in the
countryside can teach me nothing,&rdquo; he said. He could also
stand lost in thought for hours on end.</P>
<p>
Even during his lifetime he was
considered somewhat enigmatic, and fairly soon after his death he was
held to be the founder of any number of different philosophical
schools of thought. The very fact that he was so enigmatic and
ambiguous made it possible for widely differing schools of thought to
claim him as their own.</P>
<p>
We know for a certainty that he was
extremely ugly. He was potbellied, and had bulging eyes and a snub
nose. But inside he was said to be &ldquo;perfectly delightful.&rdquo;
It was also said of him that &ldquo;You can seek him in the present,
you can seek him in the past, but you will never find his equal.&rdquo;
Nevertheless he was sentenced to death for his philosophical
activities.</P>
<p>
The life of Socrates is mainly known
to us through the writings of Plato, who was one of his pupils and
who became one of the greatest philosophers of all time. Plato wrote
a number of Dialogues, or dramatized discussions on philosophy, in
which he uses Socrates as his principal character and mouthpiece.</P>
<p>
Since Plato is putting his own
philosophy in Socrates&rsquo; mouth, we cannot be sure that the words
he speaks in the dialogues were ever actually uttered by him. So it
is no easy matter to distinguish between the teachings of Socrates
and the philosophy of Plato. Exactly the same problem applies to
many other historical persons who left no written accounts. The
classic example, of course, is Jesus. We cannot be certain that the
&ldquo;historical&rdquo; Jesus actually spoke the words that Matthew
or Luke ascribed to him. Similarly, what the &ldquo;historical&rdquo;
Socrates actually said will always be shrouded in mystery.</P>
<p>
But who Socrates &ldquo;really&rdquo;
was is relatively unimportant. It is Plato&rsquo;s portrait of
Socrates that has inspired thinkers in the Western world for nearly
2,500 years.</P>
<br /><h3>The Art of Discourse</h3><br />
<p>
The essential nature of Socrates&rsquo;
art lay in the fact that he did not appear to want to instruct
people. On the contrary he gave the impression of one desiring to
learn from those he spoke with. So instead of lecturing like a
traditional schoolmaster, he discussed.</P>
<p>
Obviously he would not have become a
famous philosopher had he confined himself purely to listening
to others. Nor would he have been sentenced to death. But he
just asked questions, especially to begin a conversation, as if he
knew nothing. In the course of the discussion he would generally get
his opponents to recognize the weakness of their arguments, and,
forced into a corner, they would finally be obliged to realize what
was right and what was wrong.</P>
<p>
Socrates, whose mother was a midwife,
used to say that his art was like the art of the midwife. She does
not herself give birth to the child, but she is there to help during
its delivery. Similarly, Socrates saw his task as helping people
to &ldquo;give birth&rdquo; to the correct insight, since real
understanding must come from within. It cannot be imparted by
someone else. And only the understanding that comes from within can
lead to true insight.</P>
<p>
Let me put it more precisely: The
ability to give birth is a natural characteristic. In the same way,
everybody can grasp philosophical truths if they just use their
innate reason. Using your innate reason means reaching down
inside yourself and using what is there.</P>
<p>
By playing ignorant, Socrates forced
the people he met to use their common sense. Socrates could feign
ignorance&mdash;or pretend to be dumber than he was. We call
this Socratic irony. This enabled him to continually expose the
weaknesses in people&rsquo;s thinking. He was not averse to doing
this in the middle of the city square. If you met Socrates, you thus
might end up being made a fool of publicly.</P>
<p>
So it is not surprising that, as time
went by, people found him increasingly exasperating, especially
people who had status in the community. &ldquo;Athens is like a
sluggish horse,&rdquo; he is reputed to have said, &ldquo;and I
am the gadfly trying to sting it into life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
(What do we do with gadflies, Sophie?)</P>
<br /><h3>A Divine Voice</h3><br />
<p>
It was not in order to torment his
fellow beings that Socrates kept on stinging them. Something
within him left him no choice. He always said that he had a &ldquo;divine
voice&rdquo; inside him. Socrates protested, for example, against
having any part in condemning people to death. He moreover
refused to inform on his political enemies. This was eventually to
cost him his life.</P>
<p>
In the year 399 B.C. he was accused of
&ldquo;introducing new gods and corrupting the youth,&rdquo; as well
as not believing in the accepted gods. With a slender majority,
a jury of five hundred found him guilty.</P>
<p>
He could very likely have appealed for
leniency. At least he could have saved his life by agreeing to leave
Athens. But had he done this he would not have been Socrates. He
valued his conscience&mdash;and the truth&mdash; higher than life. He
assured the jury that he had only acted in the best interests of the
state. He was nevertheless condemned to drink hemlock. Shortly
thereafter, he drank the poison in the presence of his friends, and
died.</P>
<p>
Why, Sophie? Why did Socrates have to
die? People have been asking this question for 2,400 years. However,
he was not the only person in history to have seen things through to
the bitter end and suffered death for the sake of their convictions.</P>
<p>
I have mentioned Jesus already, and in
fact there are several striking parallels between them.</P>
<p>
Both Jesus and Socrates were enigmatic
personalities, also to their contemporaries. Neither of them wrote
down their teachings, so we are forced to rely on the picture we have
of them from their disciples. But we do know that they were both
masters of the art of discourse. They both spoke with a
characteristic self-assuredness that could fascinate as well as
exasperate. And not least, they both believed that they spoke on
behalf of something greater than themselves. They challenged the
power of the community by criticizing all forms of injustice and
corruption. And finally&mdash;their activities cost them their lives.</P>
<p>
The trials of Jesus and Socrates also
exhibit clear parallels.</P>
<p>
They could certainly both have saved
themselves by appealing for mercy, but they both felt they had a
mission that would have been betrayed unless they kept faith to the
bitter end. And by meeting their death so bravely they commanded an
enormous following, also after they had died.</P>
<p>
I do not mean to suggest that Jesus
and Socrates were alike. I am merely drawing attention to the fact
that they both had a message that was inseparably linked to their
personal courage.</P>
<br /><h3>A Joker in Athens</h3><br />
<p>
Socrates, Sophie! We aren&rsquo;t done
with him yet. We have talked about his method. But what was his
philosophical project?</P>
<p>
Socrates lived at the same time as the
Sophists. Like them, he was more concerned with man and his place in
society than with the forces of nature. As a Roman philosopher,
Cicero, said of him a few hundred years later, Socrates &ldquo;called
philosophy down from the sky and established her in the towns
and introduced her into homes and forced her to investigate life,
ethics, good and evil.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
But Socrates differed from the
Sophists in one significant way. He did not consider himself to be a
&ldquo;sophist&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a learned or wise person. Unlike
the Sophists, he did not teach for money. No, Socrates called himself
a philosopher in the true sense of the word. A &ldquo;philosopher&rdquo;
really means &ldquo;one who loves wisdom.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Are you sitting comfortably, Sophie?
Because it is central to the rest of this course that you fully
understand the difference between a sophist and a philosopher. The
Sophists took money for their more or less hairsplitting expoundings,
and sophists of this kind have come and gone from time immemorial. I
am referring to all the schoolmasters and self-opinionated
know-it-alls who are satisfied with what little they know, or who
boast of knowing a whole lot about subjects they haven&rsquo;t
the faintest notion of. You have probably come across a few of these
sophists in your young life. A real philosopher, Sophie, is a
completely different kettle of fish&mdash;the direct opposite, in
fact. A philosopher knows that in reality he knows very little. That
is why he constantly strives to achieve true insight. Socrates
was one of these rare people. He knew that he knew nothing about life
and about the world. And now comes the important part: it troubled
him that he knew so little.</P>
<p>
A philosopher is therefore someone who
recognizes that there is a lot he does not understand, and is
troubled by it. In that sense, he is still wiser than all those who
brag about their knowledge of things they know nothing about. &ldquo;Wisest
is she who knows she does not know,&rdquo; I said previously.
Socrates himself said, &ldquo;One thing only I know, and that is that
I know nothing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Remember this statement, because it is
an admission that is rare, even among philosophers. Moreover, it can
be so dangerous to say it in public that it can cost you your life.
The most subversive people are those who ask questions. Giving
answers is not nearly as threatening. Any one question can be more
explosive than a thousand answers.</P>
<p>
You remember the story of the
emperor&rsquo;s new clothes? The emperor was actually stark naked but
none of his subjects dared say so. Suddenly a child burst out, &ldquo;But
he&rsquo;s got nothing on!&rdquo; That was a courageous child,
Sophie. Like Socrates, who dared tell people how little we
humans know. The similarity between children and philosophers is
something we have already talked about.</P>
<p>
To be precise: Mankind is faced with a
number of difficult questions that we have no satisfactory
answers to. So now two possibilities present themselves: We can
either fool ourselves and the rest of the world by pretending
that we know all there is to know, or we can shut our eyes to the
central issues once and for all and abandon all progress. In this
sense, humanity is divided. People are, generally speaking, either
dead certain or totally indifferent. (Both types are crawling
around deep down in the rabbit&rsquo;s fur!)</P>
<p>
It is like dividing a deck of cards
into two piles, Sophie. You lay the black cards in one pile and the
red in the other. But from time to time a joker turns up that is
neither heart nor club, neither diamond nor spade. Socrates was this
joker in Athens. He was neither certain nor indifferent. All he knew
was that he knew nothing&mdash;and it troubled him. So he became a
philosopher&mdash;someone who does not give up but tirelessly pursues
his quest for truth.</P>
<p>
An Athenian is said to have asked the
oracle at Delphi who the wisest man in Athens was. The oracle
answered that Socrates of all mortals was the wisest. When Socrates
heard this he was astounded, to put it mildly. (He must have laughed,
Sophie!) He went straight to the person in the city whom he, and
everyone else, thought was excessively wise. But when it turned
out that this person was unable to give Socrates satisfactory answers
to his questions, Socrates realized that the oracle had been
right.</P>
<p>
Socrates felt that it was necessary to
establish a solid foundation for our knowledge. He believed that this
foundation lay in man&rsquo;s reason. With his unshakable faith
in human reason he was decidedly a rationalist.</P>
<br /><h3>The Right Insight Leads to the Right
Action</h3><br />
<p>
As I have mentioned earlier, Socrates
claimed that he was guided by a divine inner voice, and that this
&ldquo;conscience&rdquo; told him what was right. &ldquo;He who
knows what good is will do good,&rdquo; he said.</P>
<p>
By this he meant that the right
insight leads to the right action. And only he who does right can be
a &ldquo;virtuous man.&rdquo; When we do wrong it is because we don&rsquo;t
know any better. That is why it is so important to go on learning.
Socrates was concerned with finding clear and universally valid
definitions of right and wrong. Unlike the Sophists, he believed that
the ability to distinguish between right and wrong lies in people&rsquo;s
reason and not in society.</P>
<p>
You may perhaps think this last part
is a bit too obscure, Sophie. Let me put it like this: Socrates
thought that no one could possibly be happy if they acted against
their better judgment. And he who knows how to achieve happiness
will do so. Therefore, he who knows what is right will do right.
Because why would anybody choose to be unhappy?</P>
<p>
What do you think, Sophie? Can you
live a happy life if you continually do things you know deep down are
wrong? There are lots of people who lie and cheat and speak ill of
others. Are they aware that these things are not right&mdash;or fair,
if you prefer? Do you think these people are happy?</P>
<p>
Socrates didn&rsquo;t.</P>
<p>
When Sophie had read the letter,
she quickly put it in the cookie tin and crawled out into the garden.
She wanted to go indoors before her mother got back with the shopping
in order to avoid any questions about where she had been. And she had
promised to do the dishes.</P>
<p>
She had just filled the sink with water when her mother came
staggering in with two huge shopping bags. Perhaps that was why her
mother said, &ldquo;You are rather preoccupied these days, Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie didn&rsquo;t know why she said it; the words just tumbled out
of her mouth: &ldquo;So was Socrates.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Socrates?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother stared at her, wide-eyed.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was just so sad that he had to die as a result,&rdquo;
Sophie went on thoughtfully.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;My goodness! Sophie! I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m to do!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Neither did Socrates. All he knew was that he knew nothing.
And yet he was the cleverest person in Athens.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother was speechless.</P>
<p>
Finally she said, &ldquo;Is this something you&rsquo;ve learned at
school?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie shook her head energetically.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t learn anything there. The difference between
schoolteachers and philosophers is that school-teachers think they
know a lot of stuff that they try to force down our throats.
Philosophers try to figure things out together with the pupils.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re back to white rabbits again! You know
something? I demand to know who your boyfriend really is. Otherwise
I&rsquo;ll begin to think he is a bit disturbed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie turned her back on the dishes and pointed at her mother with
the dish mop.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not him who&rsquo;s disturbed. But he likes to
disturb others&mdash;to shake them out of their rut.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough of that! I think he sounds a bit too
impertinent.&rdquo; Sophie turned back to the dishes.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He is neither impertinent nor pertinent,&rdquo; said Sophie.
&ldquo;But he is trying to reach real wisdom. That&rsquo;s the great
difference between a real joker and all the other cards in the deck.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you say joker?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie nodded. &ldquo;Have you ever thought about the fact that there
are a lot of hearts and diamonds in a pack of cards? And a lot of
spades and clubs. But there&rsquo;s only one joker.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Good grief, how you talk back, Sophie!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And how you ask!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother had put all the groceries away. Now she took the newspaper
and went into the living room. Sophie thought she closed the
door more loudly than usual.</P>
<p>
Sophie finished doing the dishes and went upstairs to her room. She
had put the red silk scarf on the top shelf of the closet with the
Lego blocks. She took it down and examined it carefully.</P>
<p>

</P>
<br /><h3>Athens</h3><br />
<p>
... several tall buildings had risen from the ruins &hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Early that evening Sophie&rsquo;s mother went to visit a friend. As
soon as she was out of the house Sophie went down the garden to the
den. There she found a thick package beside the big cookie tin.
Sophie tore it open. It was a video cassette.</P>
<p>
She ran back to the house. A video tape! How on earth did the
philosopher know they had a VCR? And what was on the cassette?</P>
<p>
Sophie put the cassette into the recorder. A sprawling city appeared
on the TV screen. As the camera zoomed in on the Acropolis Sophie
realized that the city must be Athens. She had often seen pictures of
the ancient ruins there.</P>
<p>
It was a live shot. Summer-clad tourists with cameras slung about
them were swarming among the ruins. One of them looked as if he was
carrying a notice board. There it was again. Didn&rsquo;t it say
&ldquo;Hilde&rdquo;?</P>
<p>
After a minute or two there was a close-up of a middle-aged man.
He was rather short, with a black, well-trimmed beard, and he was
wearing a blue beret. He looked into the camera and said: &ldquo;Welcome
to Athens, Sophie. As you have probably guessed, I am Alberto Knox.
If not, I will just reiterate that the big rabbit is still being
pulled from the top hat of the universe.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We are standing at the Acropolis. The word means &lsquo;citadel&rsquo;&mdash;or
more precisely, &lsquo;the city on the hill.&rsquo; People have
lived up here since the Stone Age. The reason, naturally, was its
unique location. The elevated plateau was easy to defend against
marauders. From the Acropolis there was also an excellent view
down to one of the best harbors in the Mediterranean. As the early
Athens began to develop on the plain below the plateau, the Acropolis
was used as a fortress and sacred shrine... During the first half of
the fifth century B.C., a bitter war was waged against the Persians,
and in 480 the Persian king Xerxes plundered Athens and burned all
the old wooden buildings of the Acropolis. A year later the Persians
were defeated, and that was the beginning of the Golden Age of
Athens. The Acropolis was rebuilt&mdash; prouder and more magnificent
than ever&mdash;and now purely as a sacred shrine.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This was the period when Socrates walked through the streets
and squares talking with the Athenians. He could thus have witnessed
the rebirth of the Acropolis and watched the construction of all the
proud buildings we see around us. And what a building site it was!
Behind me you can see the biggest temple, the Parthenon, which
means &lsquo;the Virgin&rsquo;s Place.&rsquo; It was built in honor
of Athene, the patron goddess of Athens. The huge marble
structure does not have a single straight line; all four sides are
slightly curved to make the building appear less heavy. In spite of
its colossal dimensions, it gives the impression of lightness. In
other words, it presents an optical illusion. The columns lean
slightly inwards, and would form a pyramid 1,500 meters high if they
were continued to a point above the temple. The temple contained
nothing but a twelve-meter-high statue of Athene. The white marble,
which in those days was painted in vivid colors, was transported here
from a mountain sixteen kilometers away.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie sat with her heart in her mouth. Was this really the
philosopher talking to her? She had only seen his profile that one
time in the darkness. Could he be the same man who was now standing
at the Acropolis in Athens?</P>
<p>
He began to walk along the length of the temple and the camera
followed him. He walked right to the edge of the terrace and pointed
out over the landscape. The camera focused on an old theater which
lay just below the plateau of the Acropolis.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There you can see the old Dionysos Theater,&rdquo; continued
the man in the beret. &ldquo;It is probably the very oldest theater
in Europe. This is where the great tragedies of Aeschylus,
Sophocles, and Euripides were performed during the time of
Socrates. I referred earlier to the ill-fated King Oedipus. The
tragedy about him, by Sophocles, was first performed here. But they
also played comedies. The best known writer of comedies was
Aristophanes, who also wrote a spiteful comedy about Socrates as the
buffoon of Athens. Right at the back you can see the stone wall which
the actors used as a backdrop. It was called skene, and is the origin
of our word &lsquo;scene.&rsquo; Incidentally, the word &lsquo;theater&rsquo;
comes from an old Greek word meaning &lsquo;to see.&rsquo; But we
must get back to the philosophers, Sophie. We are going around the
Parthenon and down through the gateway ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The little man walked around the huge temple and passed some smaller
temples on his right. Then he began to walk down some steps between
several tall columns. When he reached the foot of the Acropolis, he
went up a small hill and pointed out toward Athens: &ldquo;The hill
we are standing on is called Areopagos. It was here that the Athenian
high court of justice passed judgment in murder trials. Many hundreds
of years later, St. Paul the Apostle stood here and preached about
Jesus and Christianity to the Athenians. We shall return to what
he said on a later occasion. Down to the left you can see the remains
of the old city square in Athens, the agora. With the exception of
the large temple to Hephaestos, the god of smiths and metalworkers,
only some blocks of marble are preserved. Let us go down ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The next moment he appeared among the ancient ruins. High up
beneath the sky&mdash;at the top of Sophie&rsquo;s screen&mdash;towered
the monumental Athene temple on the Acropolis. Her philosophy teacher
had seated himself on one of the blocks of marble. He looked into the
camera and said: &ldquo;We are sitting in the old agora in Athens. A
sorry sight, don&rsquo;t you think? Today, I mean. But once it was
surrounded by splendid temples, courts of justice and other public
offices, shops, a concert hall, and even a large gymnastics building.
All situated around the square, which was a large open space ... The
whole of European civilization was founded in this modest area.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Words such as politics and democracy, economy and history,
biology and physics, mathematics and logic, theology and
philosophy, ethics and psychology, theory and method, idea and system
date back to the tiny populace whose everyday life centered around
this square. This is where Socrates spent so much of his time talking
to the people he met. He might have buttonholed a slave bearing
a jar of olive oil, and asked the unfortunate man a question on
philosophy, for Socrates held that a slave had the same common sense
as a man of rank. Perhaps he stood in an animated wrangle with one of
the citizens&mdash;or held a subdued conversation with his young
pupil Plato. It is extraordinary to think about. We still speak of
Socratic or Platonic philosophy, but actually being Plato or Socrates
is quite another matter.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie certainly did think it was extraordinary to think about. But
she thought it was just as extraordinary the way her philosopher was
suddenly talking to her on a video that had been brought to her own
secret hideout in the garden by a mysterious dog.</P>
<p>
The philosopher rose from the block of marble he was sitting on and
said quietly: &ldquo;It was actually my intention to leave it at
that, Sophie. I wanted you to see the Acropolis and the remains
of the old agora in Athens. But I am not yet sure that you have
grasped just how splendid these surroundings once were ... so I am
very tempted to go a bit further. It is quite irregular of course ...
but I am sure I can count on it remaining just between the two of us.
Oh well, a tiny glimpse will suffice anyway ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He said no more, but remained standing there for a long time, staring
into the camera. While he stood there, several tall buildings had
risen from the ruins. As if by magic, all the old buildings were once
again standing.</P>
<p>
Above the skyline Sophie could still see the Acropolis, but now both
that and all the buildings down on the square were brand-new. They
were covered with gold and painted in garish colors. Gaily dressed
people were strolling about the square. Some wore swords, others
carried jars on their heads, and one of them had a roll of papyrus
under his arm.</P>
<p>
Then Sophie recognized her philosophy teacher. He was still wearing
the blue beret, but now he was dressed in a yellow tunic in the same
style as everyone else. He came toward Sophie, looked into the
camera, and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better! Now we are in the Athens of antiquity,
Sophie. I wanted you to come here in person, you see. We are in the
year 402 B.C., only three years before Socrates dies. I hope you
appreciate this exclusive visit because it was very difficult to hire
a video camera ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie felt dizzy. How could this weird man suddenly be in Athens
2,400 years ago? How could she be seeing a video film of a totally
different age? There were no videos in antiquity ... so could this be
a movie?</P>
<p>
But all the marble buildings looked real. If they had recreated all
of the old square in Athens as well as the Acropolis just for the
sake of a film&mdash;the sets would have cost a fortune. At any rate
it would be a colossal price to pay just to teach Sophie about
Athens.</P>
<p>
The man in the beret looked up at her again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you see those two men over there under the colonnade?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie noticed an elderly man in a crumpled tunic. He had a long
unkempt beard, a snub nose, eyes like gimlets, and chubby cheeks.
Beside him stood a handsome young man.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is Socrates and his young pupil, Plato. You are going to
meet them personally.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The philosopher went over to the two men, took off his beret, and
said something which Sophie did not understand. It must have
been in Greek. Then he looked into the camera and said, &ldquo;I told
them you were a Norwegian girl who would very much like to meet
them. So now Plato will give you some questions to think about. But
we must do it quickly before the guards discover us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie felt the blood pounding in her temples as the young man
stepped forward and looked into the camera.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Welcome to Athens, Sophie,&rdquo; he said in a gentle voice.
He spoke with an accent. &ldquo;My name is Plato and I am going to
give you four tasks. First you must think over how a baker can bake
fifty absolutely identical cookies. Then you can ask yourself why all
horses are the same. Next you must decide whether you think that man
has an immortal soul. And finally you must say whether men and women
are equally sensible. Good luck!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Then the picture on the TV screen disappeared. Sophie wound and
rewound the tape but she had seen all there was.</P>
<p>
Sophie tried to think things through clearly. But as soon as she
thought one thought, another one crowded in before she had
thought the first one to its end.</P>
<p>
She had known from the start that her philosophy teacher was
eccentric. But when he started to use teaching methods that
defied all the laws of nature, Sophie thought he was going too far.</P>
<p>
Had she really seen Socrates and Plato on TV? Of course not, that was
impossible. But it definitely wasn&rsquo;t a cartoon.</P>
<p>
Sophie took the cassette out of the video recorder and ran up to her
room with it. She put it on the top shelf with all the Lego blocks.
Then she sank onto the bed, exhausted, and fell asleep.</P>
<p>
Some hours later her mother came into the room. She shook Sophie
gently and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Mmmm?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone to sleep with all your clothes on!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie blinked her eyes sleepily.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to Athens,&rdquo; she mumbled. That was all
she could manage to say as she turned over and went back to sleep.</P>
<br /><h3>Plato</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip; a longing to return to the realm of the soul&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie woke with a start early the next morning. She glanced at the
clock. It was only a little after five but she was so wide awake that
she sat up in bed. Why was she wearing a dress? Then she remembered
everything.</P>
<p>
She climbed onto a stool and looked on the top shelf of the closet.
Yes&mdash;there, at the back, was the video cassette. It hadn&rsquo;t
been a dream after all; at least, not all of it.</P>
<p>
But she couldn&rsquo;t really have seen Plato and Socrates ...
oh, never mind! She didn&rsquo;t have the energy to think about it
any more. Perhaps her mother was right, perhaps she was acting a bit
nuts these days.</P>
<p>
Anyway, she couldn&rsquo;t go back to sleep. Perhaps she ought to go
down to the den and see if the dog had left another letter. Sophie
crept downstairs, put on a pair of jogging shoes, and went out.</P>
<p>
In the garden everything was wonderfully clear and still. The birds
were chirping so energetically that Sophie could hardly keep from
laughing. The morning dew twinkled in the grass like drops of
crystal. Once again she was struck by the incredible wonder of the
world.</P>
<p>
Inside the old hedge it was also very damp. Sophie saw no new letter
from the philosopher, but nevertheless she wiped off one of the thick
roots and sat down.</P>
<p>
She recalled that the video-Plato had given her some questions to
answer. The first was something about how a baker could bake fifty
identical cookies.</P>
<p>
Sophie had to think very carefully about that, because it definitely
wouldn&rsquo;t be easy. When her mother occasionally baked a
batch of cookies, they were never all exactly the same. But then she
was not an expert pastry cook; sometimes the kitchen looked as if a
bomb had hit it. Even the cookies they bought at the baker&rsquo;s
were never exactly the same. Every single cookie was shaped
separately in the baker&rsquo;s hands.</P>
<p>
Then a satisfied smile spread over Sophie&rsquo;s face. She
remembered how once she and her father went shopping while her mother
was busy baking Christmas cookies. When they got back there were a
lot of gingerbread men spread out on the kitchen table. Even though
they weren&rsquo;t all perfect, in a way they were all the same. And
why was that? Obviously because her mother had used the same mold for
all of them.</P>
<p>
Sophie felt so pleased with herself for having remembered the
incident that she pronounced herself done with the first question. If
a baker makes fifty absolutely identical cookies, he must be
using the same pastry mold for all of them. And that&rsquo;s that!</P>
<p>
Then the video-Plato had looked into the camera and asked why all
horses were the same. But they weren&rsquo;t, at all! On the
contrary, Sophie thought no two horses were the same, just as no two
people were the same.</P>
<p>
She was ready to give up on that one when she remembered what
she had thought about the cookies. No one of them was exactly like
any of the others. Some were a bit thicker than the others, and some
were broken. But still, everyone could see that they were&mdash;in a
way&mdash; &ldquo;exactly the same.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
What Plato was really asking was perhaps why a horse was always a
horse, and not, for example, a cross between a horse and a pig.
Because even though some horses were as brown as bears and others
were as white as lambs, all horses had something in common. Sophie
had yet to meet a horse with six or eight legs, for example.</P>
<p>
But surely Plato couldn&rsquo;t believe that what made all horses
alike was that they were made with the same mold?</P>
<p>
Then Plato had asked her a really difficult question. Does man have
an immortal soul? That was something Sophie felt quite unqualified to
answer. All she knew was that dead bodies were either cremated or
buried, so there was no future for them. If man had an immortal soul,
one would have to believe that a person consisted of two separate
parts: a body that gets worn out after many years&mdash;and a soul
that operates more or less independently of what happens to the
body. Her grandmother had said once that she felt it was only
her body that was old. Inside she had always been the same young
girl-The thought of the &ldquo;young girl&rdquo; led Sophie to the
last question: Are women and men equally sensible? She was not so
sure about that. It depended on what Plato meant by sensible.</P>
<p>
Something the philosopher had said about Socrates came into her mind.
Socrates had pointed out that everyone could understand
philosophical truths if they just used their common sense. He had
also said that a slave had the same common sense as a nobleman.
Sophie was sure that he would also have said that women had the same
common sense as men.</P>
<p>
While she sat thinking, there was a sudden rustling in the hedge, and
the sound of something puffing and blowing like a steam engine. The
next second, the golden Labrador slipped into the den. It had a large
envelope in its mouth.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hermes!&rdquo; cried Sophie. &ldquo;Drop it! Drop it!&rdquo;
The dog dropped the envelope in Sophie&rsquo;s lap, and Sophie
stretched out her hand to pat the dog&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Good boy,
Hermes!&rdquo; she said. The dog lay down and allowed itself to be
patted. But after a couple of minutes it got up and began to push its
way back through the hedge the same way it had come in. Sophie
followed with the brown envelope in her hand. She crawled through the
dense thicket and was soon outside the garden.</P>
<p>
Hermes had already started to run toward the edge of the woods, and
Sophie followed a few yards behind. Twice the dog turned around and
growled, but Sophie was not to be deterred.</P>
<p>
This time she was determined to find the philosopher&mdash;even
if it meant running all the way to Athens.</P>
<p>
The dog ran faster and suddenly turned off down a narrow path. Sophie
chased him, but after a few minutes he turned and faced her, barking
like a watchdog. Sophie still refused to give up, taking the
opportunity to lessen the distance between them.</P>
<p>
Hermes turned and raced down the path. Sophie realized that she
would never catch up with him. She stood quite still for what seemed
like an eternity, listening to him running farther and farther away.
Then all was silent.</P>
<p>
She sat down on a tree stump by a little clearing in the woods. She
still had the brown envelope in her hand. She opened it, drew out
several typewritten pages, and began to read:</P>
<br /><h3>PLATO&rsquo;S ACADEMY</h3><br />
<p>
Thank you for the pleasant time we
spent together, Sophie. In Athens, I mean. So now I have at
least introduced myself. And since I have also introduced Plato, we
might as well begin without further ado.</P>
<p>
Plato (428-347 B.C.) was twenty-nine
years old when Socrates drank the hemlock. He had been a pupil of
Socrates for some time and had followed his trial very closely.
The fact that Athens could condemn its noblest citizen to death did
more than make a profound impression on him. It was to shape the
course of his entire philosophic endeavor.</P>
<p>
To Plato, the death of Socrates was a
striking example of the conflict that can exist between society as it
really is and the true or ideal society. Plato&rsquo;s first deed as
a philosopher was to publish Socrates&rsquo; Apology, an account
of his plea to the large jury.</P>
<p>
As you will no doubt recall, Socrates
never wrote anything down, although many of the pre-Socratics
did. The problem is that hardly any of their written material
remains. But in the case of Plato, we believe that all his
principal works have been preserved. (In addition to Socrates&rsquo;
Apology, Plato wrote a collection of Epistles and about twenty-five
philosophical Dialogues.) That we have these works today is due not
least to the fact that Plato set up his own school of philosophy in a
grove not far from Athens, named after the legendary Greek hero
Academus. The school was therefore known as the Academy. (Since then,
many thousands of &ldquo;academies&rdquo; have been established all
over the world. We still speak of &ldquo;academics&rdquo; and
&ldquo;academic subjects.&rdquo;)</P>
<p>
The subjects taught at Plato&rsquo;s
Academy were philosophy, mathematics, and gymnastics&mdash;although
perhaps &ldquo;taught&rdquo; is hardly the right word. Lively
discourse was considered most important at Plato&rsquo;s Academy. So
it was not purely by chance that Plato&rsquo;s writings took the form
of dialogues.</P>
<br /><h3>The Eternally True, Eternally
Beautiful, and Eternally Good</h3><br />
<p>
In the introduction to this course I
mentioned that it could often be a good idea to ask what a particular
philosopher&rsquo;s project was. So now I ask: what were the
problems Plato was concerned with?</P>
<p>
Briefly, we can establish that Plato
was concerned with the relationship between what is eternal and
immutable, on the one hand, and what &ldquo;flows,&rdquo; on the
other. (Just like the pre-Socratics, in fact.) We&rsquo;ve seen how
the Sophists and Socrates turned their attention from questions
of natural philosophy to problems related to man and society.
And yet in one sense, even Socrates and the Sophists were preoccupied
with the relationship between the eternal and immutable, and the
&ldquo;flowing.&rdquo; They were interested in the problem as it
related to human morals and society&rsquo;s ideals or virtues. Very
briefly, the Sophists thought that perceptions of what was right or
wrong varied from one city-state to another, and from one
generation to the next. So right and wrong was something that
&ldquo;flowed.&rdquo; This was totally unacceptable to Socrates. He
believed in the existence of eternal and absolute rules for what was
right or wrong. By using our common sense we can all arrive at these
immutable norms, since human reason is in fact eternal and
immutable.</P>
<p>
Do you follow, Sophie? Then along
comes Plato. He is concerned with both what is eternal and immutable
in nature and what is eternal and immutable as regards morals
and society. To Plato, these two problems were one and the same. He
tried to grasp a &ldquo;reality&rdquo; that was eternal and
immutable.</P>
<p>
And to be quite frank, that is
precisely what we need philosophers for. We do not need them to
choose a beauty queen or the day&rsquo;s bargain in tomatoes. (This
is why they are often unpopular!) Philosophers will try to ignore
highly topical affairs and instead try to draw people&rsquo;s
attention to what is eternally &ldquo;true,&rdquo; eternally
&ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo; and eternally &ldquo;good.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
We can thus begin to glimpse at least
the outline of Plato&rsquo;s philosophical project. But let&rsquo;s
take one thing at a time. We are attempting to understand an
extraordinary mind, a mind that was to have a profound influence on
all subsequent European philosophy.</P>
<br /><h3>The World of Ideas</h3><br />
<p>
Both Empedocles and Democritus had
drawn attention to the fact that although in the natural world
everything &ldquo;flows,&rdquo; there must nevertheless be
&ldquo;something&rdquo; that never changes (the &ldquo;four roots,&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;atoms&rdquo;). Plato agreed with the proposition as
such&mdash;but in quite a different way.</P>
<p>
Plato believed that everything
tangible in nature &ldquo;flows.&rdquo; So there are no &ldquo;substances&rdquo;
that do not dissolve. Absolutely everything that belongs to the
&ldquo;material world&rdquo; is made of a material that time can
erode, but everything is made after a timeless &ldquo;mold&rdquo; or
&ldquo;form&rdquo; that is eternal and immutable.</P>
<p>
You see? No, you don&rsquo;t.</P>
<p>
Why are horses the same, Sophie? You
probably don&rsquo;t think they are at all. But there is something
that all horses have in common, something that enables us to identify
them as horses. A particular horse &ldquo;flows,&rdquo; naturally. It
might be old and lame, and in time it will die. But the &ldquo;form&rdquo;
of the horse is eternal and immutable.</P>
<p>
That which is eternal and immutable,
to Plato, is therefore not a physical &ldquo;basic substance,&rdquo;
as it was for Empedocles and Democritus. Plato&rsquo;s conception was
of eternal and immutable patterns, spiritual and abstract in their
nature that all things are fashioned after.</P>
<p>
Let me put it like this: The
pre-Socratics had given a reasonably good explanation of natural
change without having to presuppose that anything actually &ldquo;changed.&rdquo;
In the midst of nature&rsquo;s cycle there were some eternal and
immutable smallest elements that did not dissolve, they thought. Fair
enough, Sophie! But they had no reasonable explanation for how these
&ldquo;smallest elements&rdquo; that were once building blocks in a
horse could suddenly whirl together four or five hundred years
later and fashion themselves into a completely new horse. Or an
elephant or a crocodile, for that matter. Plato&rsquo;s point was
that Democritus&rsquo; atoms never fashioned themselves into an
&ldquo;eledile&rdquo; or a &ldquo;crocophant.&rdquo; This was what
set his philosophical reflections going.</P>
<p>
If you already understand what I am
getting at, you may skip this next paragraph. But just in case, I
will clarify: You have a box of Lego and you build a Lego horse. You
then take it apart and put the blocks back in the box. You cannot
expect to make a new horse just by shaking the box. How could Lego
blocks of their own accord find each other and become a new horse
again? No, you have to rebuild the horse, Sophie. And the reason you
can do it is that you have a picture in your mind of what the horse
looked like. The Lego horse is made from a model which remains
unchanged from horse to horse.</P>
<p>
How did you do with the fifty
identical cookies? Let us assume that you have dropped in from outer
space and have never seen a baker before. You stumble into a
tempting bakery&mdash;and there you catch sight of fifty
identical gingerbread men on a shelf. I imagine you would wonder how
they could be exactly alike. It might well be that one of them has an
arm missing, another has lost a bit of its head, and a third has a
funny bump on its stomach. But after careful thought, you would
nevertheless conclude that all gingerbread men have something in
common. Although none of them is perfect, you would suspect that
they had a common origin. You would realize that all the cookies were
formed in the same mold. And what is more, Sophie, you are now seized
by the irresistible desire to see this mold. Because clearly, the
mold itself must be utter perfection&mdash;and in a sense, more
beautiful&mdash;in comparison with these crude copies.</P>
<p>
If you solved this problem all by
yourself, you arrived at the philosophical solution in exactly the
same way that Plato did.</P>
<p>
Like most philosophers, he &ldquo;dropped
in from outer space.&rdquo; (He stood up on the very tip of one of
the fine hairs of the rabbit&rsquo;s fur.) He was astonished at the
way all natural phenomena could be so alike, and he concluded
that it had to be because there are a limited number of forms
&ldquo;behind&rdquo; everything we see around us. Plato called these
forms ideas. Behind every horse, pig, or human being, there is
the &ldquo;idea horse,&rdquo; &ldquo;idea pig,&rdquo; and &ldquo;idea
human being.&rdquo; (In the same way, the bakery we spoke of can have
gingerbread men, gingerbread horses, and gingerbread pigs. Because
every self-respecting bakery has more than one mold. But one
mold is enough for each type of gingerbread cookie.)</P>
<p>
Plato came to the conclusion that
there must be a reality behind the &ldquo;material world.&rdquo; He
called this reality the world of ideas; it contained the eternal and
immutable &ldquo;patterns&rdquo; behind the various phenomena we come
across in nature. This remarkable view is known as Plato&rsquo;s
theory of ideas.</P>
<br /><h3>True Knowledge</h3><br />
<p>
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been
following me, Sophie dear. But you may be wondering whether Plato was
being serious. Did he really believe that forms like these actually
existed in a completely different reality?</P>
<p>
He probably didn&rsquo;t believe it
literally in the same way for all his life, but in some of his
dialogues that is certainly how he means to be understood. Let us try
to follow his train of thought.</P>
<p>
A philosopher, as we have seen, tries
to grasp something that is eternal and immutable. It would serve no
purpose, for instance, to write a philosophic treatise on the
existence of a particular soap bubble. Partly because one would
hardly have time to study it in depth before it burst, and partly
because it would probably be rather difficult to find a market for a
philosophic treatise on something nobody has ever seen, and which
only existed for five seconds.</P>
<p>
Plato believed that everything we see
around us in nature, everything tangible, can be likened to a
soap bubble, since nothing that exists in the world of the
senses is lasting. We know, of course, that sooner or later every
human being and every animal will die and decompose. Even a block of
marble changes and gradually disintegrates. (The Acropolis is
falling into ruin, Sophie! It is a scandal, but that&rsquo;s the way
it is.) Plato&rsquo;s point is that we can never have true knowledge
of anything that is in a constant state of change. We can only have
opinions about things that belong to the world of the senses,
tangible things. We can only have true knowledge of things that
can be understood with our reason.</P>
<p>
All right, Sophie, I&rsquo;ll explain
it more clearly: a gingerbread man can be so lopsided after all
that baking that it can be quite hard to see what it is meant to be.
But having seen dozens of gingerbread men that were more or less
successful, I can be pretty sure what the cookie mold was like. I can
guess, even though I have never seen it. It might not even be an
advantage to see the actual mold with my own eyes because we cannot
always trust the evidence of our senses. The faculty of vision can
vary from person to person. On the other hand, we can rely on what
our reason tells us because that is the same for everyone.</P>
<p>
If you are sitting in a classroom with
thirty other pupils, and the teacher asks the class which color of
the rainbow is the prettiest, he will probably get a lot of different
answers. But if he asks what 8 times 3 is, the whole class will&mdash;we
hope&mdash;give the same answer. Because now reason is speaking and
reason is, in a way, the direct opposite of &ldquo;thinking so&rdquo;
or &ldquo;feeling.&rdquo; We could say that reason is eternal and
universal precisely because it only expresses eternal and universal
states.</P>
<p>
Plato found mathematics very absorbing
because mathematical states never change. They are therefore
states we can have true knowledge of. But here we need an example.</P>
<p>
Imagine you find a round pinecone out
in the woods. Perhaps you say you &ldquo;think&rdquo; it looks
completely round, whereas Joanna insists it is a bit flattened on one
side. (Then you start arguing about it!) But you cannot have true
knowledge of anything you can perceive with your eyes. On the other
hand you can say with absolute certainty that the sum of the angles
in a circle is 360 degrees. In this case you would be talking about
an ideal circle which might not exist in the physical world but which
you can clearly visualize. (You are dealing with the hidden
gingerbread-man mold and not with the particular cookie on the
kitchen table.)</P>
<p>
In short, we can only have inexact
conceptions of things we perceive with our senses. But we can have
true knowledge of things we understand with our reason. The sum
of the angles in a triangle will remain 180 degrees to the end of
time. And similarly the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; horse will walk on four
legs even if all the horses in the sensory world break a leg.</P>
<br /><h3>An Immortal Soul</h3><br />
<p>
As I explained, Plato believed that
reality is divided into two regions.</P>
<p>
One region is the world of the senses,
about which we can only have approximate or incomplete knowledge
by using our five (approximate or incomplete) senses. In this sensory
world, &ldquo;everything flows&rdquo; and nothing is permanent.
Nothing in the sensory world is, there are only things that come to
be and pass away.</P>
<p>
The other region is the world of
ideas, about which we can have true knowledge by using our reason.
This world of ideas cannot be perceived by the senses, but the ideas
(or forms) are eternal and immutable.</P>
<p>
According to Plato, man is a dual
creature. We have a body that &ldquo;flows,&rdquo; is inseparably
bound to the world of the senses, and is subject to the same fate as
everything else in this world&mdash;a soap bubble, for example. All
our senses are based in the body and are consequently unreliable.
But we also have an immortal soul&mdash;and this soul is the realm of
reason. And not being physical, the soul can survey the world of
ideas.</P>
<p>
But that&rsquo;s not all, Sophie. IT&rsquo;S
NOT ALL!</P>
<p>
Plato also believed that the soul
existed before it inhabited the body, (it was lying on a shelf
in the closet with all the cookie molds.) But as soon as the soul
wakes up in a human body, it has forgotten all the perfect ideas.
Then something starts to happen. In fact, a wondrous process begins.
As the human being discovers the various forms in the natural world,
a vague recollection stirs his soul. He sees a horse&mdash;but an
imperfect horse. (A gingerbread horse!) The sight of it is
sufficient to awaken in the soul a faint recollection of the perfect
&ldquo;horse,&rdquo; which the soul once saw in the world of ideas,
and this stirs the soul with a yearning to return to its true realm.
Plato calls this yearning eras&mdash;which means love. The soul,
then, experiences a &ldquo;longing to return to its true
origin.&rdquo; From now on, the body and the whole sensory world is
experienced as imperfect and insignificant. The soul yearns to fly
home on the wings of love to the world of ideas. It longs to be freed
from the chains of the body.</P>
<p>
Let me quickly emphasize that Plato is
describing an ideal course of life, since by no means all humans set
the soul free to begin its journey back to the world of ideas. Most
people cling to the sensory world&rsquo;s &ldquo;reflections&rdquo;
of ideas. They see a horse&mdash;and another horse. But they never
see that of which every horse is only a feeble imitation. (They rush
into the kitchen and stuff themselves with gingerbread cookies
without so much as a thought as to where they came from.) What Plato
describes is the philosophers&rsquo;way. His philosophy can be
read as a description of philosophic practice.</P>
<p>
When you see a shadow, Sophie, you
will assume that there must be something casting the shadow. You see
the shadow of an animal. You think it may be a horse, but you are not
quite sure. So you turn around and see the horse itself&mdash;which
of course is infinitely more beautiful and sharper in outline than
the blurred &ldquo;horse-shadow.&rdquo; Plato believed similarly that
all natural phenomena are merely shadows of the eternal forms or
ideas. But most people are content with a life among shadows. They
give no thought to what is casting the shadows. They think shadows
are all there are, never realizing even that they are, in fact,
shadows. And thus they pay no heed to the immortality of their own
soul.</P>
<br /><h3>Out of the Darkness of the Cave</h3><br />
<p>
Plato relates a myth which illustrates
this. We call it the Myth of the Cave. I&rsquo;ll retell it in my own
words.</P>
<p>
Imagine some people living in an
underground cave. They sit with their backs to the mouth of the cave
with their hands and feet bound in such a way that they can only look
at the back wall of the cave. Behind them is a high wall, and behind
that wall pass human-like creatures, holding up various figures above
the top of the wall. Because there is a fire behind these
figures, they cast flickering shadows on the back wall of the
cave. So the only thing the cave dwellers can see is this shadow
play. They have been sitting in this position since they were born,
so they think these shadows are all there are.</P>
<p>
Imagine now that one of the cave
dwellers manages to free himself from his bonds. The first thing he
asks himself is where all these shadows on the cave wall come from.
What do you think happens when he turns around and sees the figures
being held up above the wall? To begin with he is dazzled by the
sharp sunlight. He is also dazzled by the clarity of the figures
because until now he has only seen their shadow. If he manages to
climb over the wall and get past the fire into the world outside, he
will be even more dazzled. But after rubbing his eyes he will be
struck by the beauty of everything. For the first time he will see
colors and clear shapes. He will see the real animals and
flowers that the cave shadows were only poor reflections of. But even
now he will ask himself where all the animals and flowers come from.
Then he will see the sun in the sky, and realize that this is what
gives life to these flowers and animals, just as the fire made the
shadows visible.</P>
<p>
The joyful cave dweller could now have
gone skipping away into the countryside, delighting in his new-found
freedom. But instead he thinks of all the others who are still
down in the cave. He goes back. Once there, he tries to convince the
cave dwellers that the shadows on the cave wall are but flickering
reflections of &ldquo;real&rdquo; things. But they don&rsquo;t
believe him. They point to the cave wall and say that what they see
is all there is. Finally they kill him.</P>
<p>
What Plato was illustrating in the
Myth of the Cave is the philosopher&rsquo;s road from shadowy images
to the true ideas behind all natural phenomena. He was probably also
thinking of Socrates, whom the &ldquo;cave dwellers&rdquo;
killed because he disturbed their conventional ideas and tried to
light the way to true insight. The Myth of the Cave illustrates
Socrates&rsquo; courage and his sense of pedagogic responsibility.</P>
<p>
Plato&rsquo;s point was that the
relationship between the darkness of the cave and the world
beyond corresponds to the relationship between the forms of the
natural world and the world of ideas. Not that he meant that the
natural world is dark and dreary, but that it is dark and dreary in
comparison with the clarity of ideas. A picture of a beautiful
landscape is not dark and dreary either. But it is only a picture.</P>
<br /><h3>The Philosophic State</h3><br />
<p>
The Myth of the Cave is found in
Plato&rsquo;s dialogue the Republic. In this dialogue Plato also
presents a picture of the &ldquo;ideal state,&rdquo; that is to say
an imaginary, ideal, or what we would call a Utopian, state. Briefly,
we could say that Plato believed the state should be governed by
philosophers. He bases his explanation of this on the construction
of the human body.</P>
<p>
According to Plato, the human body is
composed of three parts: the head, the chest, and the abdomen. For
each of these three parts there is a corresponding faculty of the
soul. Reason belongs to the head, will belongs to the chest, and
appetite belongs to the abdomen. Each of these soul faculties also
has an ideal, or &ldquo;virtue.&rdquo; Reason aspires to wisdom, Will
aspires to courage, and Appetite must be curbed so that temperance
can be exercised. Only when the three parts of the body function
together as a unity do we get a harmonious or &ldquo;virtuous&rdquo;
individual. At school, a child must first learn to curb its
appetites, then it must develop courage, and finally reason leads to
wisdom.</P>
<p>
Plato now imagines a state built up
exactly like the tripartite human body. Where the body has head,
chest, and abdomen, the State has rulers, auxiliaries, and fa-borers
(farmers, for example). Here Plato clearly uses Greek medical science
as his model. Just as a healthy and harmonious man exercises balance
and temperance, so a &ldquo;virtuous&rdquo; state is characterized by
everyone knowing their place in the overall picture.</P>
<p>
Like every aspect of Plato&rsquo;s
philosophy, his political philosophy is characterized by
rationalism. The creation of a good state depends on its being
governed with reason. Just as the head governs the body, so
philosophers must rule society.</P>
<p>
Let us attempt a simple illustration
of the relationship between the three parts of man and the state:</P>
<p>
BODY SOUL VIRTUE STATE</P>
<p>
head reason wisdom rulers</P>
<p>
chest will courage auxiliaries</P>
<p>
abdomen appetite temperance laborers</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Plato&rsquo;s ideal state is not
unlike the old Hindu caste system, in .which each and every person
has his or her particular function for the good of the whole. Even
before Plato&rsquo;s time the Hindu caste system had the same
tripartite division between the auxiliary caste (or priest
caste), the warrior caste, and the laborer caste. Nowadays we
would perhaps call Plato&rsquo;s state totalitarian. But it is worth
noting that he believed women could govern just as effectively as men
for the simple reason that the rulers govern by virtue of their
reason. Women, he asserted, have exactly the same powers of reasoning
as men, provided they get the same training and are exempt from child
rearing and housekeeping. In Plato&rsquo;s ideal state, rulers and
warriors are not allowed family life or private property. The rearing
of children is considered too important to be left to the individual
and should be the responsibility of the state. (Plato was the first
philosopher to advocate state-organized nursery schools and full-time
education.)</P>
<p>
After a number of significant
political setbacks, Plato wrote the tows, in which he described the
&ldquo;constitutional state&rdquo; as the next-best state. He now
reintroduced both private property and family ties. Women&rsquo;s
freedom thus became more restricted. However, he did say that a state
that does not educate and train women is like a man who only trains
his right arm.</P>
<p>
All in all, we can say that Plato had
a positive view of women&mdash;considering the time he lived in. In
the dialogue Symposium, he gives a woman, the legendary priestess
Diotima, the honor of having given Socrates his philosophic
insight.</P>
<p>
So that was Plato, Sophie. His
astonishing theories have been discussed&mdash;and criticized&mdash;for
more than two thousand years. The first man to do so was one of
the pupils from his own Academy. His name was Aristotle, and he was
the third great philosopher from Athens.</P>
<p>
I&rsquo;ll say no more!</P>
<p>
While Sophie had been reading about Plato, the sun had risen over the
woods to the east. It was peeping over the horizon just as she was
reading how one man clambered out of the cave and blinked in the
dazzling light outside.</P>
<p>
It was almost as if she had herself emerged from an underground cave.
Sophie felt that she saw nature in a completely different way after
reading about Plato. It was rather like having been color-blind. She
had seen some shadows but had not seen the clear ideas.</P>
<p>
She was not sure Plato was right in everything he had said about the
eternal patterns, but it was a beautiful thought that all living
things were imperfect copies of the eternal forms in the world of
ideas. Because wasn&rsquo;t it true that all flowers, trees, human
beings, and animals were &ldquo;imperfect&rdquo;?</P>
<p>
Everything she saw around her was so beautiful and so alive that
Sophie had to rub her eyes to really believe it. But nothing she was
looking at now would last. And yet&mdash;in a hundred years the same
flowers and the same animals would be here again. Even if every
single flower and every single animal should fade away and be
forgotten, there would be something that &ldquo;recollected&rdquo;
how it all looked.</P>
<p>
Sophie gazed out at the world. Suddenly a squirrel ran up the trunk
of a pine tree. It circled the trunk a few times and disappeared into
the branches.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you before!&rdquo; thought Sophie. She
realized that maybe it was not the same squirrel that she had seen
previously, but she had seen the same &ldquo;form.&rdquo; For all she
knew, Plato could have been right. Maybe she really had seen the
eternal &ldquo;squirrel&rdquo; before&mdash;in the world of ideas,
before her soul had taken residence in a human body.</P>
<p>
Could it be true that she had lived before? Had her soul existed
before it got a body to move around in? And was it really true that
she carried a little golden nugget inside her&mdash;a jewel that
cannot be corroded by time, a soul that would live on when her own
body grew old and died?</P>
<br /><h3>The Major&rsquo;s Cabin</h3><br />
<p>
... the girl in the mirror winked with both eyes&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
It was only a quarter past seven. There was no need to hurry home.
Sophie&rsquo;s mother always took it easy on Sundays, so she would
probably sleep for another two hours.</P>
<p>
Should she go a bit farther into the woods and try to find Alberto
Knox? And why had the dog snarled at her so viciously?</P>
<p>
Sophie got up and began to walk down the path Hermes had taken.
She had the brown envelope with the pages on Plato in her hand.
Wherever the path diverged she took the wider one.</P>
<p>
Birds were chirping everywhere&mdash;in the trees and in the air, in
bush and thicket. They were busily occupied with their morning
pursuits. They knew no difference between weekdays and Sundays. Who
had taught them to do all that? Was there a tiny computer inside each
one of them, programming them to do certain things?</P>
<p>
The path led up over a little hill, then steeply down between tall
pine trees. The woods were so dense now that she could only see a few
yards between the trees.</P>
<p>
Suddenly she caught sight of something glittering between the
pine trunks. It must be a little lake. The path went the other way
but Sophie picked her way among the trees. Without really knowing
why, she let her feet lead her.</P>
<p>
The lake was no bigger than a soccer field. Over on the other side
she could see a red-painted cabin in a small clearing surrounded by
silver birches. A faint wisp of smoke was rising from the chimney.</P>
<p>
Sophie went down to the water&rsquo;s edge. It was very muddy in many
places, but then she noticed a rowboat. It was drawn halfway out of
the water. There was a pair of oars in it.</P>
<p>
Sophie looked around. Whatever she did, it would be impossible to get
around the lake to the red cabin without getting her shoes
soaked. She went resolutely over to the boat and pushed it into the
water. Then she climbed aboard, set the oars in the rowlocks, and
rowed across the lake. The boat soon touched the opposite bank.
Sophie went ashore and tried to pull the boat up after her. The bank
was much steeper here than the opposite bank had been.</P>
<p>
She glanced over her shoulder only once before walking up toward
the cabin.</P>
<p>
She was quite startled at her own boldness. How did she dare do this?
She had no idea. It was as if &ldquo;something&rdquo; impelled
her.</P>
<p>
Sophie went up to the door and knocked. She waited a while but nobody
answered. She tried the handle cautiously, and the door opened.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Is anyone at home?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She went in and found herself in a living room. She dared not shut
the door behind her.</P>
<p>
Somebody was obviously living here. Sophie could hear wood crackling
in the old stove. Someone had been here very recently.</P>
<p>
On a big dining table stood a typewriter, some books, a couple of
pencils, and a pile of paper. A smaller table and two chairs stood by
the window that overlooked the lake. Apart from that there was very
little furniture, although the whole of one wall was lined with
bookshelves filled with books. Above a white chest of drawers
hung a large round mirror in a heavy brass frame. It looked very old.</P>
<p>
On one of the walls hung two pictures. One was an oil painting of a
white house which lay a stone&rsquo;s throw from a little bay with a
red boathouse. Between the house and the boathouse was a sloping
garden with an apple tree, a few thick bushes, and some rocks. A
dense fringe of birch trees framed the garden like a garland. The
title of the painting was &ldquo;Bjerkely.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Beside that painting hung an old portrait of a man sitting in a chair
by a window. He had a book in his lap. This picture also had a little
bay with trees and rocks in the background. It looked as though it
had been painted several hundred years ago. The title of the picture
was &ldquo;Berkeley.&rdquo; The painter&rsquo;s name was Smibert.</P>
<p>
Berkeley and Bjerkely. How strange!</P>
<p>
Sophie continued her investigation. A door led from the living room
to a small kitchen. Someone had just done the dishes. Plates and
glasses were piled on a tea towel, some of them still glistening with
drops of soapy water. There was a tin bowl on the floor with some
leftover scraps of food in it. Whoever lived here had a pet, a
dog or a cat.</P>
<p>
Sophie went back to the living room. Another door led to a tiny
bedroom. On the floor next to the bed there were a couple of blankets
in a thick bundle. Sophie discovered some golden hairs on the
blankets. Here was the evidence! Now Sophie knew that the occupants
of the cabin were Alberto Knox and Hermes.</P>
<p>
Back in the living room, Sophie stood in front of the mirror. The
glass was matte and scratched, and her reflection
correspondingly blurred. Sophie began to make faces at herself like
she did at home in the bathroom. Her reflection did exactly the same,
which was only to be expected.</P>
<p>
But all of a sudden something scary happened. Just once&mdash;in the
space of a split second&mdash;Sophie saw quite clearly that the girl
in the mirror winked with both eyes. Sophie started back in fright.
If she herself had winked&mdash;how could she have seen the other
girl wink? And not only that, it seemed as though the other girl had
winked at Sophie as if to say: I can see you, Sophie. I am in here,
on the other side.</P>
<p>
Sophie felt her heart beating, and at the same time she heard a dog
barking in the distance. Hermes! She had to get out of here at once.
Then she noticed a green wallet on the chest of drawers under the
mirror. It contained a hundred-crown note, a fifty, and a school
I.D. card. It showed a picture of a girl with fair hair. Under the
picture was the girl&rsquo;s name: Hilde Moller Knag ...</P>
<p>
Sophie shivered. Again she heard the dog bark. She had to get out, at
once!</P>
<p>
As she hurried past the table she noticed a white envelope
between all the books and the pile of paper. It had one word written
on it: SOPHIE.</P>
<p>
Before she had time to realize what she was doing, she grabbed the
envelope and stuffed it into the brown envelope with the Plato pages.
Then she rushed out of the door and slammed it behind her.</P>
<p>
The barking was getting closer. But worst of all was that the boat
was gone. After a second or two she saw it, adrift halfway across the
lake. One of the oars was floating beside it. All because she hadn&rsquo;t
been able to pull it completely up on land. She heard the dog barking
quite nearby now and saw movements between the trees on the other
side of the lake.</P>
<p>
Sophie didn&rsquo;t hesitate any longer. With the big envelope
in her hand, she plunged into the bushes behind the cabin. Soon she
was having to wade through marshy ground, sinking in several times to
well above her ankles. But she had to keep going. She had to get
home.</P>
<p>
Presently she stumbled onto a path. Was it the path she had taken
earlier? She stopped to wring out her dress. And then she began to
cry.</P>
<p>
How could she have been so stupid? The worst of all was the boat. She
couldn&rsquo;t forget the sight of the row-boat with the one oar
drifting helplessly on the lake. It was all so embarrassing, so
shameful. . .</P>
<p>
The philosophy teacher had probably reached the lake by now. He would
need the boat to get home. Sophie felt almost like a criminal. But
she hadn&rsquo;t done it on purpose.</P>
<p>
The envelope! That was probably even worse. Why had she taken it?
Because her name was on it, of course, so in a way it was hers. But
even so, she felt like a thief. And what&rsquo;s more, she had
provided the evidence that it was she who had been there.</P>
<p>
Sophie drew the note out of the envelope. It said:</P>
<p>
<I>What came first&mdash;the chicken or the &ldquo;idea&rdquo;
chicken ?</I></P>
<p>
<I>Are we born with innate &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;? What is the
difference between a plant, an animal, and a human? </I>
</P>
<p>
<I>Why does it rain? </I>
</P>
<p>
<I>What does it take to live a good life?</I></P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie couldn&rsquo;t possibly think about these questions right now,
but she assumed they had something to do with the next philosopher.
Wasn&rsquo;t he called Aristotle?</P>
<p>
When she finally saw the hedge after running so far through the woods
it was like swimming ashore after a shipwreck. The hedge looked funny
from the other side.</P>
<p>
She didn&rsquo;t look at her watch until she had crawled into the
den. It was ten-thirty. She put the big envelope into the biscuit tin
with the other papers and stuffed the note with the new questions
down her tights.</P>
<p>
Her mother was on the telephone when she came in. When she saw Sophie
she hung up quickly.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Where on earth have you been?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I... went for a walk ... in the woods,&rdquo; she stammered.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie stood silently, watching the water dripping from her dress.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I called Joanna...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Joanna?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother brought her some dry clothes. Sophie only just managed to
hide the philosopher&rsquo;s note. Then they sat together in the
kitchen, and her mother made some hot chocolate.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Were you with him?&rdquo; she asked after a while.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Him?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie could only think about her philosophy teacher.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;With him, yes. Him.... your rabbit!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie shook her head.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you do when you&rsquo;re together, Sophie? Why are you
so wet?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie sat staring gravely at the table. But deep down inside she was
laughing. Poor Mom, now she had that to worry about.</P>
<p>
She shook her head again. Then more questions came raining down on
her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now I want the truth. Were you out all night? Why did you go
to bed with your clothes on? Did you sneak out as soon as I had gone
to bed? You&rsquo;re only fourteen, Sophie. I demand to know who you
are seeing!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie started to cry. Then she talked. She was still frightened, and
when you are frightened you usually talk.</P>
<p>
She explained that she had woken up very early and had gone for a
walk in the woods. She told her mother about the cabin and the boat,
and about the mysterious mirror. But she mentioned nothing about the
secret correspondence course. Neither did she mention the green
wallet. She didn&rsquo;t quite know why, but she had to keep Hilde
for herself.</P>
<p>
Her mother put her arms around Sophie, and Sophie knew that her
mother believed her now.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a boyfriend,&rdquo; Sophie sniffed. &ldquo;It
was just something I said because you were so upset about the white
rabbit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And you really went all the way to the major&rsquo;s cabin
...&rdquo; said her mother thoughtfully.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The major&rsquo;s cabin?&rdquo; Sophie stared at her mother.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The little woodland cabin is called the major&rsquo;s cabin
because some years ago an army major lived there for a time. He was
rather eccentric, a little crazy, I think. But never mind that. Since
then the cabin has been unoccupied.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t! There&rsquo;s a philosopher living there
now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh stop, don&rsquo;t start fantasizing again!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie stayed in her room, thinking about what had happened. Her head
felt like a roaring circus full of lumbering elephants, silly
clowns, daring trapeze flyers, and trained monkeys. But one image
recurred unceasingly&mdash; a small rowboat with one oar drifting in
a lake deep in the woods&mdash;and someone needing the boat to get
home.</P>
<p>
She felt sure that the philosophy teacher didn&rsquo;t wish her any
harm, and would certainly forgive her if he knew she had been to his
cabin. But she had broken an agreement. That was all the thanks
he got for taking on her philosophic education. How could she make up
for it? Sophie took out her pink notepaper and began to write:</P>
<p>
Dear Philosopher, It was me who was in your cabin early Sunday
morning. I wanted so much to meet you and discuss some of the
philosophic problems. For the moment I am a Plato fan, but I am not
so sure he was right about ideas or pattern pictures existing in
another reality. Of course they exist in our souls, but I think&mdash;for
the moment anyway&mdash; that this is a different thing. I have to
admit too that I am not altogether convinced of the immortality
of the soul. Personally, I have no recollections from my former
lives. If you could convince me that my deceased grandmother&rsquo;s
soul is happy in the world of ideas, I would be most grateful.</P>
<p>
Actually, it was not for philosophic reasons that I started to write
this letter (which I shall put in a pink envelope with a lump of
sugar). I just wanted to say I was sorry for being disobedient. I
tried to pull the boat completely up on shore but I was obviously
not strong enough. Or perhaps a big wave dragged the boat out again.</P>
<p>
I hope you managed to get home without getting your feet wet. If not,
it might comfort you to know that I got soaked and will probably have
a terrible cold. But that&rsquo;ll be my own fault.</P>
<p>
I didn&rsquo;t touch anything in the cabin, but I am sorry to say
that I couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation to take the envelope that
was on the table. It wasn&rsquo;t because I wanted to steal anything,
but as my name was on it, I thought in my confusion that it belonged
to me. I am really and truly sorry, and I promise never to disappoint
you again.</P>
<p>
P.S. I will think all the new questions through very carefully,
starting now.</P>
<p>
P.P.S. Is the mirror with the brass frame above the white chest of
drawers an ordinary mirror or a magic mirror? I&rsquo;m only asking
because I am not used to seeing my own reflection wink with both
eyes.</P>
<p>
With regards from your sincerely interested pupil, SOPHIE</P>
<p>
Sophie read the letter through twice before she put it in the
envelope. She thought it was less formal than the previous letter she
had written. Before she went downstairs to the kitchen to get a
lump of sugar she looked at the note with the day&rsquo;s questions:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What came first&mdash;the chicken or the &ldquo;idea&rdquo;
chicken?</P>
<p>
This question was just as tricky as the old riddle of the chicken and
the egg. There would be no chicken without the egg, and no egg
without the chicken. Was it really just as complicated to figure out
whether the chicken or the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; chicken came first?
Sophie understood what Plato meant. He meant that the &ldquo;idea&rdquo;
chicken had existed in the world of ideas long before chickens
existed in the sensory world. According to Plato, the soul had &ldquo;seen&rdquo;
the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; chicken before it took up residence in a body.
But wasn&rsquo;t this just where Sophie thought Plato must be
mistaken? How could a person who had never seen a live chicken or a
picture of a chicken ever have any &ldquo;idea&rdquo; of a chicken?
Which brought her to the next question:</P>
<p>
Are we born with innate &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;? Most unlikely, thought
Sophie. She could hardly imagine a newborn baby being especially well
equipped with ideas. One could obviously never be sure, because the
fact that the baby had no language did not necessarily mean that it
had no ideas in its head. But surely we have to see things in the
world before we can know anything about them.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is the difference between a plant, an animal, and a
human?&rdquo; Sophie could immediately see very clear differences.</P>
<p>
For instance, she did not think a plant had a very complicated
emotional life. Who had ever heard of a bluebell with a broken heart?
A plant grows, takes nourishment, and produces seeds so that it can
reproduce itself. That&rsquo;s about all one could say about plants.
Sophie concluded that everything that applied to plants also
applied to animals and humans. But animals had other attributes as
well. They could move, for example. (When did a rose ever run a
marathon?) It was a bit harder to point to any differences between
animals and humans. Humans could think, but couldn&rsquo;t animals do
so as well? Sophie was convinced that her cat Sherekan could think.
At least, it could be very calculating. But could it reflect on
philosophical questions? Could a cat speculate about the difference
between a plant, an animal, and a human? Hardly! A cat could probably
be either contented or unhappy, but did it ever ask itself if
there was a God or whether it had an immortal soul? Sophie thought
that was extremely doubtful. But the same problem was raised here as
with the baby and the innate ideas. It was just as difficult to talk
to a cat about such questions as it would be to discuss them with a
baby.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why does it rain?&rdquo; Sophie shrugged her shoulders. It
probably rains because seawater evaporates and the clouds condense
into raindrops. Hadn&rsquo;t she learnt that in the third grade? Of
course, one could always say that it rains so that plants and animals
can grow. But was that true? Had a shower any actual purpose?</P>
<p>
The last question definitely had something to do with purpose: &ldquo;What
does it take to live a good life?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The philosopher had written something about this quite early on in
the course. Everybody needs food, warmth, love, and care. Such basics
were the primary condition for a good life, at any rate. Then he had
pointed out that people also needed to find answers to certain
philosophical questions. It was probably also quite important to have
a job you liked. If you hated traffic, for instance, you would not be
very happy as a taxi driver. And if you hated doing homework it would
probably be a bad idea to become a teacher. Sophie loved animals and
wanted to be a vet. But in any case she didn&rsquo;t think it was
necessary to win a million in the lottery to live a good life.</P>
<p>
Quite the opposite, more likely. There was a saying:</P>
<p>
The devil finds work for idle hands.</P>
<p>
Sophie stayed in her room until her mother called her down to a big
midday meal. She had prepared sirloin steak and baked potatoes. There
were cloudberries and cream for dessert.</P>
<p>
They talked about all kinds of things. Sophie&rsquo;s mother asked
her how she wanted to celebrate her fifteenth birthday. It was only a
few weeks away.</P>
<p>
Sophie shrugged.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to invite anyone? I mean, don&rsquo;t
you want to have a party?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We could ask Martha and Anne Marie ... and Helen. And
Joanna, of course. And Jeremy, perhaps. But that&rsquo;s for you to
decide. I remember my own fifteenth birthday so clearly, you know. It
doesn&rsquo;t seem all that long ago. I felt I was already quite
grown up. Isn&rsquo;t it odd, Sophie! I don&rsquo;t feel I have
changed at all since then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t. Nothing changes. You have just developed,
gotten older...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Mm ... that was a very grownup thing to say. I just think it&rsquo;s
all happened so very quickly.&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>Aristotle</h3><br />
<p>
...a meticulous organizer who wanted to clarify our concepts &hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
While her mother was taking her afternoon nap, Sophie went down to
the den. She had put a lump of sugar in the pink envelope and written
&ldquo;To Alberto&rdquo; on the outside.</P>
<p>
There was no new letter, but after a few minutes Sophie heard
the dog approaching.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hermes!&rdquo; she called, and the next moment he had pushed
his way into the den with a big brown envelope in his mouth.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; Sophie put her arm around the dog, which was
snorting and snuffling like a walrus. She took the pink envelope with
the lump of sugar and put it in the dog&rsquo;s mouth. He crawled
through the hedge and made off into the woods again.</P>
<p>
Sophie opened the big envelope apprehensively, wondering whether
it would contain anything about the cabin and the boat.</P>
<p>
It contained the usual typed pages held together with a paperclip.
But there was also a loose page inside. On it was written:</P>
<p>
Dear Miss Sleuth, or, to be more exact, Miss Burglar. The case
has already been handed over to the police.</P>
<p>
Not really. No, I&rsquo;m not angry. If you are just as curious when
it comes to discovering answers to the riddles of philosophy, I&rsquo;d
say your adventure was very promising. It&rsquo;s just a little
annoying that I&rsquo;ll have to move now. Still, I have no one to
blame but myself, I suppose. I might have known you were a person who
would always want to get to the bottom of things.</P>
<p>
Greetings, Alberto</P>
<p>
Sophie was relieved. So he was not angry after all. But why would he
have to move?</P>
<p>
She took the papers and ran up to her room. It would be prudent to be
in the house when her mother woke up. Lying comfortably on her bed,
she began to read about Aristotle.</P>
<br /><h3>PHILOSOPHER AND SCIENTIST</h3><br />
<p>
Dear Sophie: You were probably
astonished by Plato&rsquo;s theory or ideas. You are not the only
one! I do not know whether you swallowed the whole thing&mdash;hook,
line, and sinker&mdash;or whether you had any critical comments. But
if you did have, you can be sure that the self-same criticism was
raised by Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), who was a pupil at Plato&rsquo;s
Academy for almost twenty years.</P>
<p>
Aristotle was not a native of Athens.
He was born in Macedonia and came to Plato&rsquo;s Academy when Plato
was 61. Aristotle&rsquo;s father was a respected physician&mdash; and
therefore a scientist. This background already tells us something
about Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophic project. What he was most
interested in was nature study. He was not only the last of the great
Greek philosophers, he was Europe&rsquo;s first great biologist.</P>
<p>
Taking it to extremes, we could say
that Plato was so engrossed in his eternal forms, or &ldquo;ideas,&rdquo;
that he took very little notice of the changes in nature. Aristotle,
on the other hand, was preoccupied with just these changes&mdash;or
with what we nowadays describe as natural processes.</P>
<p>
To exaggerate even more, we could say
that Plato turned his back on the sensory world and shut his eyes to
everything we see around us. (He wanted to escape from the cave and
look out over the eternal world of ideas!) Aristotle did the
opposite: he got down on all fours and studied frogs and fish,
anemones and poppies.</P>
<p>
While Plato used his reason, Aristotle
used his senses as well.</P>
<p>
We find decisive differences between
the two, not least in their writing. Plato was a poet and
mythologist; Aristotle&rsquo;s writings were as dry and precise
as an encyclopedia. On the other hand, much of what he wrote was
based on up-to-the-minute field studies.</P>
<p>
Records from antiquity refer to 170
titles supposedly written by Aristotle. Of these, 47 are preserved.
These are not complete books; they consist largely of lecture notes.
In his time, philosophy was still mainly an oral activity.</P>
<p>
The significance of Aristotle in
European culture is due not least to the fact that he created the
terminology that scientists use today. He was the great organizer who
founded and classified the various sciences.</P>
<p>
Since Aristotle wrote on all the
sciences, I will limit myself to some of the most important
areas. Now that I have told you such a lot about Plato, you must
start by hearing how Aristotle refuted Plato&rsquo;s theory of ideas.
Later we will look at the way he formulated his own natural
philosophy, since it was Aristotle who summed up what the natural
philosophers before him had said. We&rsquo;ll see how he categorizes
our concepts and founds the discipline of Logic as a science. And
finally I&rsquo;ll tell you a little about Aristotle&rsquo;s view of
man and society.</P>
<br /><h3>No Innate Ideas</h3><br />
<p>
Like the philosophers before him,
Plato wanted to find the eternal and immutable in the midst of all
change. So he found the perfect ideas that were superior to the
sensory world. Plato furthermore held that ideas were more real than
all the phenomena of nature. First came the idea &ldquo;horse,&rdquo;
then came all the sensory world&rsquo;s horses trotting along like
shadows on a cave wall. The idea &ldquo;chicken&rdquo; came before
both the chicken and the egg.</P>
<p>
Aristotle thought Plato had turned the
whole thing upside down. He agreed with his teacher that the
particular horse &ldquo;flows&rdquo; and that no horse lives forever.
He also agreed that the actual form of the horse is eternal and
immutable. But the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; horse was simply a concept that
we humans had formed after seeing a certain number of horses. The
&ldquo;idea&rdquo; or &ldquo;form&rdquo; horse thus had no existence
of its own. To Aristotle, the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; or the &ldquo;form&rdquo;
horse was made up of the horse&rsquo;s characteristics&mdash;which
define what we today call the horse species.</P>
<p>
To be more precise: by &ldquo;form&rdquo;
horse, Aristotle meant that which is common to all horses. And here
the metaphor of the gingerbread mold does not hold up because
the mold exists independently of the particular gingerbread
cookies. Aristotle did not believe in the existence of any such molds
or forms that, as it were, lay on their own shelf beyond the natural
world. On the contrary, to Aristotle the &ldquo;forms&rdquo; were in
the things, because they were the particular characteristics of these
things.</P>
<p>
So Aristotle disagreed with Plato that
the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; chicken came before the chicken. What
Aristotle called the &ldquo;form&rdquo; chicken is present in every
single chicken as the chicken&rsquo;s particular set
characteristics&mdash;for one, that it lays eggs. The real chicken
and the &ldquo;form&rdquo; chicken are thus just as inseparable as
body and soul.</P>
<p>
And that is really the essence of
Aristotle&rsquo;s criticism of Plato&rsquo;s theory of ideas. But you
should not ignore the fact that this was a dramatic turn of thought.
The highest degree of reality, in Plato&rsquo;s theory, was that
which we think with our reason. It was equally apparent to Aristotle
that the highest degree of reality is that which we perceive with our
senses. Plato thought that all the things we see in the natural world
were purely reflections of things that existed in the higher
reality of the world of ideas&mdash;and thereby in the human soul.
Aristotle thought the opposite: things that are in the human soul
were purely reflections of natural objects. So nature is the real
world. According to Aristotle, Plato was trapped in a mythical world
picture in which the human imagination was confused with the real
world.</P>
<p>
Aristotle pointed out that nothing
exists in consciousness that has not first been experienced by the
senses. Plato would have said that there is nothing in the natural
world that has not first existed in the world of ideas. Aristotle
held that Plato was thus &ldquo;doubling the number of things.&rdquo;
He explained a horse by referring to the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; horse.
But what kind of an explanation is that, Sophie? Where does the
&ldquo;idea&rdquo; horse come from, is my question. Might there not
even be a third horse, which the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; horse is just an
imitation of?</P>
<p>
Aristotle held that all our thoughts
and ideas have come into our consciousness through what we have heard
and seen. But we also have an innate power of reason. We have no
innate ideas, as Plato held, but we have the innate faculty of
organizing all sensory impressions into categories and classes.
This is how concepts such as &ldquo;stone,&rdquo; &ldquo;plant,&rdquo;
&ldquo;animal,&rdquo; and &ldquo;human&rdquo; arise. Similarly
there arise concepts like &ldquo;horse,&rdquo; &ldquo;lobster,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;canary.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Aristotle did not deny that humans
have innate reason. On the contrary, it is precisely reason,
according to Aristotle, that is man&rsquo;s most distinguishing
characteristic. But our reason is completely empty until we have
sensed something. So man has no innate &ldquo;ideas.&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>The Form of a Thing Is Its Specific
Characteristics</h3><br />
<p>
Having come to terms with Plato&rsquo;s
theory of ideas, Aristotle decided that reality consisted of
various separate things that constitute a unity of form and
substance. The &ldquo;substance&rdquo; is what things are made of,
while the &ldquo;form&rdquo; is each thing&rsquo;s specific
characteristics.</P>
<p>
A chicken is fluttering about in front
of you, Sophie. The chicken&rsquo;s &ldquo;form&rdquo; is precisely
that it flutters&mdash;and that it cackles and lays eggs. So by the
&ldquo;form&rdquo; of a chicken, we mean the specific characteristics
of its species&mdash;or in other words, what it does. When the
chicken dies&mdash;and cackles no more&mdash;its &ldquo;form&rdquo;
ceases to exist. The only thing that remains is the chicken&rsquo;s
&ldquo;substance&rdquo; (sadly enough, Sophie), but then it is
no longer a chicken.</P>
<p>
As I said earlier, Aristotle was
concerned with the changes in nature. &ldquo;Substance&rdquo; always
contains the potentiality to realize a specific &ldquo;form.&rdquo;
We could say that &ldquo;substance&rdquo; always strives toward
achieving an innate potentiality. Every change in nature, according
to Aristotle, is a transformation of substance from the
&ldquo;potential&rdquo; to the &ldquo;actual.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Yes, I&rsquo;ll explain what I mean,
Sophie. See if this funny story helps you. A sculptor is working on a
large block of granite. He hacks away at the formless block every
day. One day a little boy comes by and says, &ldquo;What are you
looking for?&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; answers
the sculptor. After a few days the little boy comes back, and now the
sculptor has carved a beautiful horse out of the granite. The boy
stares at it in amazement, then he turns to the sculptor and says,
&ldquo;How did you know it was in there?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
How indeed! In a sense, the sculptor
had seen the horse&rsquo;s form in the block of granite, because that
particular block of granite had the potentiality to be formed
into the shape or a horse. Similarly Aristotle believed that
everything in nature has the potentiality of realizing, or achieving,
a specific &ldquo;form.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Let us return to the chicken and the
egg. A chicken&rsquo;s egg has the potentiality to become a chicken.
This does not mean that all chicken&rsquo;s eggs become chickens&mdash;many
of them end up on the breakfast table as fried eggs, omelettes,
or scrambled eggs, without ever having realized their potentiality.
But it is equally obvious that a chicken&rsquo;s egg cannot become a
goose. That potentiality is not within a chicken&rsquo;s egg. The
&ldquo;form&rdquo; of a thing, then, says something about its
limitation as well as its potentiality.</P>
<p>
When Aristotle talks about the
&ldquo;substance&rdquo; and &ldquo;form&rdquo; of things, he does not
only refer to living organisms. Just as it is the chicken&rsquo;s
&ldquo;form&rdquo; to cackle, flutter its wings, and lay eggs, it is
the form of the stone to fall to the ground. Just as the chicken
cannot help cackling, the stone cannot help falling to the ground.
You can, of course, lift a stone and hurl it high into the air, but
because it is the stone&rsquo;s nature to fall to the ground, you
cannot hurl it to the moon. (Take care when you perform this
experiment, because the stone might take revenge and find the
shortest route back to the earth!)</P>
<br /><h3>The Final Cause</h3><br />
<p>
Before we leave the subject of all
living and dead things having a &ldquo;form&rdquo; that says
something about their potential &ldquo;action,&rdquo; I must add that
Aristotle had a remarkable view of causality in nature.</P>
<p>
Today when we talk about the &ldquo;cause&rdquo;
of anything, we mean how it came to happen. The windowpane was
smashed because Peter hurled a stone through it; a shoe is made
because the shoemaker sews pieces of leather together. But Aristotle
held that there were different types of cause in nature. Altogether
he named four different causes. It is important to understand what he
meant by what he called the &ldquo;final cause.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
In the case of window smashing, it is
quite reasonable to ask why Peter threw the stone. We are thus asking
what his purpose was. There can be no doubt that purpose played a
role, also, in the matter of the shoe being made. But Aristotle also
took into account a similar &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; when considering
the purely lifeless processes in nature. Here&rsquo;s an example:</P>
<p>
Why does it rain, Sophie? You have
probably learned at school that it rains because the moisture in the
clouds cools and condenses into raindrops that are drawn to the earth
by the force of gravity. Aristotle would have nodded in agreement.
But he would have added that so far you have only mentioned three of
the causes. The &ldquo;material cause&rdquo; is that the moisture
(the clouds) was there at the precise moment when the air cooled. The
&ldquo;efficient cause&rdquo; is that the moisture cools, and the
&ldquo;formal cause&rdquo; is that the &ldquo;form,&rdquo; or nature
of the water, is to fall to the earth. But if you stopped there,
Aristotle would add that it rains because plants and animals need
rainwater in order to grow. This he called the &ldquo;final
cause.&rdquo; Aristotle assigns the raindrops a life-task, or
&ldquo;purpose.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
We would probably turn the whole thing
upside down and say that plants grow because they find moisture. You
can see the difference, can&rsquo;t you, Sophie? Aristotle believed
that there is a purpose behind everything in nature. It rains so that
plants can grow; oranges and grapes grow so that people can eat them.</P>
<p>
That is not the nature of scientific
reasoning today. We say that food and water are necessary conditions
of life for man and beast. Had we not had these conditions we would
not have existed. But it is not the purpose of water or oranges to be
food for us.</P>
<p>
In the question of causality then, we
are tempted to say that Aristotle was wrong. But let us not be too
hasty. Many people believe that God created the world as it is so
that all His creatures could live in it. Viewed in this way, it can
naturally be claimed that there is water in the rivers because
animals and humans need water to live. But now we are talking about
God&rsquo;s purpose. The raindrops and the waters of the river have
no interest in our welfare.</P>
<br /><h3>Logic</h3><br />
<p>
The distinction between &ldquo;form&rdquo;
and &ldquo;substance&rdquo; plays an important part in Aristotle&rsquo;s
explanation of the way we discern things in the world.</P>
<p>
When we discern things, we classify
them in various groups or categories. I see a horse, then I see
another horse, and another. The horses are not exactly alike, but
they have something in common, and this common something is the
horse&rsquo;s &ldquo;form.&rdquo; Whatever might be distinctive,
or individual, belongs to the horse&rsquo;s &ldquo;substance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
So we go around pigeonholing
everything. We put cows in cowsheds, horses in stables, pigs in
pigsties, and chickens in chicken coops. The same happens when
Sophie Amundsen tidies up her room. She puts her books on the
bookshelf, her schoolbooks in her schoolbag, and her magazines in the
drawer. Then she folds her clothes neatly and puts them in the
closet&mdash;underwear on one shelf, sweaters on another, and socks
in a drawer on their own. Notice that we do the same thing in our
minds. We distinguish between things made of stone, things made of
wool, and things made of rubber. We distinguish between things
that are alive or dead, and we distinguish between vegetable, animal,
and human.</P>
<p>
Do you see, Sophie? Aristotle wanted
to do a thorough clearing up in nature&rsquo;s &ldquo;room.&rdquo; He
tried to show that everything in nature belongs to different
categories and subcategories. (Hermes is a live creature, more
specifically an animal, more specifically a vertebrate, more
specifically a mammal, more specifically a dog, more
specifically a Labrador, more specifically a male Labrador.)</P>
<p>
Go into your room, Sophie. Pick up
something, anything, from the floor. Whatever you take, you will
find that what you are holding belongs to a higher category The day
you see something you are unable to classify you will get a shock.
If, for example, you discover a small whatsit, and you can&rsquo;t
really say whether it is animal, vegetable, or mineral&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
think you would dare touch it.</P>
<p>
Saying animal, vegetable, and mineral
reminds me of that party game where the victim is sent outside the
room, and when he comes in again he has to guess what everyone
else is thinking of. Everyone has agreed to think of Fluffy, the cat,
which at the moment is in the neighbor&rsquo;s garden. The victim
comes in and begins to guess. The others must only answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
or &ldquo;no.&rdquo; If the victim is a good Aristotelian&mdash;and
therefore no victim&mdash;the game could go pretty much as follows:</P>
<p>
Is it concrete? (Yes!) Mineral? (No!)
Is it alive? (Yes!) Vegetable? (No!) Animal? (Yes!) Is it a bird?
(No!) Is it a mammal? (Yes!) Is it the whole animal? (Yes!) Is it a
cat? (Yes!) Is it Fluffy? (Yeah! Laughter. . .)</P>
<p>
So Aristotle invented that game. We
ought to give Plato the credit for having invented hide-and-seek.
Democritus has already been credited with having invented Lego.</P>
<p>
Aristotle was a meticulous organizer
who set out to clarify our concepts. In fact, he founded the
science of Logic. He demonstrated a number of laws governing
conclusions or proofs that were valid. One example will suffice. If I
first establish that &ldquo;all living creatures are mortal&rdquo;
(first premise), and then establish that &ldquo;Hermes is a living
creature&rdquo; (second premise), I can then elegantly conclude
that &ldquo;Hermes is mortal.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The example demonstrates that
Aristotle&rsquo;s logic was based on the correlation of terms, in
this case &ldquo;living creature&rdquo; and &ldquo;mortal.&rdquo;
Even though one has to admit that the above conclusion is 100% valid,
we may also add that it hardly tells us anything new. We already knew
that Hermes was &ldquo;mortal.&rdquo; (He is a &ldquo;dog&rdquo; and
all dogs are &ldquo;living creatures&rdquo;&mdash;which are &ldquo;mortal,&rdquo;
unlike the rock of Mount Everest.) Certainly we knew that, Sophie.
But the relationship between classes of things is not always so
obvious. From time to time it can be necessary to clarify our
concepts.</P>
<p>
For example: Is it really possible
that tiny little baby mice suckle just like lambs and piglets? Mice
certainly do not lay eggs. (When did I last see a mouse&rsquo;s egg?)
So they give birth to live young&mdash;just like pigs and sheep. But
we call animals that bear live young mammals&mdash;and mammals are
animals that feed on their mother&rsquo;s milk. So&mdash;we got
there. We had the answer inside us but we had to think it through. We
forgot for the moment that mice really do suckle from their mother.
Perhaps it was because we have never seen a baby mouse being
suckled, for the simple reason that mice are rather shy of
humans when they suckle their young.</P>
<br /><h3>Nature&rsquo;s Scale</h3><br />
<p>
When Aristotle &ldquo;clears up&rdquo;
in life, he first of all points out that everything in the natural
world can be divided into two main categories. On the one hand there
are nonliving things, such as stones, drops of water, or clumps of
soil. These things have no potentiality for change. According to
Aristotle, nonliving things can only change through external
influence. Only living things have the potentiality for change.</P>
<p>
Aristotle divides &ldquo;living
things&rdquo; into two different categories. One comprises
plants, and the other creatures. Finally, these &ldquo;creatures&rdquo;
can also be divided into two subcategories, namely animals and
humans.</P>
<p>
You have to admit that Aristotle&rsquo;s
categories are clear and simple. There is a decisive difference
between a living and a nonliving thing, for example a rose and a
stone, just as there is a decisive difference between a plant and an
animal, for example a rose and a horse. I would also claim that there
definitely is a difference between a horse and a man. But what
exactly does this difference consist of? Can you tell me that?</P>
<p>
Unfortunately I do not have time to
wait while you write the answer down and put it in a pink envelope
with a lump of sugar, so I&rsquo;ll answer myself. When Aristotle
divides natural phenomena into various categories, his
criterion is the object&rsquo;s characteristics, or more
specifically what it can do or what it does.</P>
<p>
All living things (plants, animals,
humans) have the ability to absorb nourishment, to grow, and to
propagate. All &ldquo;living creatures&rdquo; (animals and humans)
have in addition the ability to perceive the world around them and to
move about. Moreover, all humans have the ability to think&mdash;or
otherwise to order their perceptions into various categories and
classes.</P>
<p>
So there are in reality no sharp
boundaries in the natural world. We observe a gradual transition
from simple growths to more complicated plants, from simple animals
to more complicated animals. At the top of this &ldquo;scale&rdquo;
is man&mdash;who according to Aristotle lives the whole life of
nature. Man grows and absorbs nourishment like plants, he has
feelings and the ability to move like animals, but he also has a
specific characteristic peculiar to humans, and that is the ability
to think rationally.</P>
<p>
Therefore, man has a spark of divine
reason, Sophie. Yes, I did say divine. From time to time Aristotle
reminds us that there must be a God who started all movement in the
natural world. Therefore God must be at the very top of nature&rsquo;s
scale.</P>
<p>
Aristotle imagined the movement of the
stars and the planets guiding all movement on Earth. But there had to
e something causing the heavenly bodies to move. Aristotle
called this the &ldquo;first mover,&rdquo; or &ldquo;God.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;first mover&rdquo; is itself at rest, but it is the &ldquo;formal
cause&rdquo; of the movement of the heavenly bodies, and thus of all
movement in nature.</P>
<br /><h3>Ethics</h3><br />
<p>
Let us go back to man, Sophie.
According to Aristotle, man&rsquo;s &ldquo;form&rdquo; comprises a
soul, which has a plant-like part, an animal part, and a rational
part. And now he asks: How should we live? What does it require to
live a good life? His answer: Man can only achieve happiness by using
all his abilities and capabilities.</P>
<p>
Aristotle held that there are three
forms of happiness. The first form of happiness is a life of pleasure
and enjoyment. The second form of happiness is a life as a free
and responsible citizen. The third form of happiness is a life as
thinker and philosopher.</P>
<p>
Aristotle then emphasized that all
three criteria must be present at the same time for man to find
happiness and fulfillment. He rejected all forms of imbalance. Had he
lived today he might have said that a person who only develops his
body lives a life that is just as unbalanced as someone who only uses
his head. Both extremes are an expression of a warped way of life.</P>
<p>
The same applies in human
relationships, where Aristotle advocated the &ldquo;Golden
Mean.&rdquo; We must be neither cowardly nor rash, but courageous
(too little courage is cowardice, too much is rashness), neither
miserly nor extravagant but liberal (not liberal enough is
miserly, too liberal is extravagant). The same goes for eating. It is
dangerous to eat too little, but also dangerous to eat too much.
The ethics of both Plato and Aristotle contain echoes of Greek
medicine: only by exercising balance and temperance will I achieve a
happy or &ldquo;harmonious&rdquo; life.</P>
<br /><h3>Politics</h3><br />
<p>
The undesirability of cultivating
extremes is also expressed in Aristotle&rsquo;s view of society. He
says that man is by nature a &ldquo;political animal.&rdquo; Without
a society around us, we are not real people, he claimed. He pointed
out that the family and the village satisfy our primary needs of
food, warmth, marriage, and child rearing. But the highest form of
human fellowship is only to be found in the state.</P>
<p>
This leads to the question of how the
state should be organized. (You remember Plato&rsquo;s &ldquo;philosophic
state&rdquo;?) Aristotle describes three good forms of constitution.</P>
<p>
One is monarchy, or kingship&mdash;which
means there is only one head of state. For this type of constitution
to be good, it must not degenerate into &ldquo;tyranny&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, when one ruler governs the state to his own advantage. Another
good form of constitution is aristocracy, in which there is a larger
or smaller group of rulers. This constitutional form must beware
of degenerating into an &ldquo;oligarchy&rdquo;&mdash;when the
government is run by a few people. An example of that would be a
junta. The third good constitutional form is what Aristotle
called polity, which means democracy. But this form also has its
negative aspect. A democracy can quickly develop into mob rule. (Even
if the tyrannic Hitler had not become head of state in Germany^ all
the lesser Nazis could have formed a terrifying mob rule.)</P>
<br /><h3>Views on Women</h3><br />
<p>
Finally, let us look at Aristotle&rsquo;s
views on women. His was unfortunately not as uplifting as Plato&rsquo;s.
Aristotle was more inclined to believe that women were incomplete in
some way. A woman was an &ldquo;unfinished man.&rdquo; In
reproduction, woman is passive and receptive whilst man is
active and productive; for the child inherits only the male
characteristics, claimed Aristotle. He believed that all the
child&rsquo;s characteristics lay complete in the male sperm. The
woman was the soil, receiving and bringing forth the seed, whilst the
man was the &ldquo;sower.&rdquo; Or, in Aristotelian language, the
man provides the &ldquo;form&rdquo; and the woman contributes the
&ldquo;substance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
It is of course both astonishing and
highly regrettable that an otherwise so intelligent man could be so
wrong about the relationship of the sexes. But it demonstrates two
things: first, that Aristotle could not have had much practical
experience regarding the lives of women and children, and
second, it shows how wrong things can go when men are allowed to
reign supreme in the fields of philosophy and science.</P>
<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s erroneous view of
the sexes was doubly harmful because it was his&mdash;rather than
Plato&rsquo;s&mdash;view that held sway throughout the Middle Ages.
The church thus inherited a view of women that is entirely without
foundation in the Bible. Jesus was certainly no woman hater!</P>
<p>
I&rsquo;ll say no more. But you will
be hearing from me again.</P>
<p>
When Sophie had read the chapter on Aristotle one and a half times,
she returned it to the brown envelope and remained sitting, staring
into space. She suddenly became aware of the mess surrounding
her. Books and ring binders lay scattered on the floor. Socks and
sweaters, tights and jeans hung half out of the closet. On the chair
in front of the writing desk was a huge pile of dirty laundry.</P>
<p>
Sophie had an irresistible desire to clear up. The first thing she
did was to pull all the clothes out of the closet and onto the floor.
It was necessary to start all over. Then she began folding her things
very neatly and stacking them all tidily on the shelves. The
closet had seven shelves. One was for underwear, one for socks and
tights, and one for jeans. She gradually filled up each shelf. She
never had any question about where to put anything. Dirty laundry
went into a plastic bag she found on the bottom shelf. One thing she
did have trouble with&mdash;a white knee-length stocking. The problem
was that the other one of the pair was missing. What&rsquo;s more, it
had never been Sophie&rsquo;s.</P>
<p>
She examined it carefully. There was nothing to identify the
owner, but Sophie had a strong suspicion about who the owner was. She
threw it up onto the top shelf to join the Lego, the video cassette,
and the red silk scarf.</P>
<p>
Sophie turned her attention to the floor. She sorted books, ring
binders, magazines, and posters&mdash;exactly as the philosophy
teacher had described in the chapter on Aristotle. When she had done
that, she made her bed and got started on her writing desk.</P>
<p>
The last thing she did was to gather all the pages on Aristotle into
a neat pile. She fished out an empty ring binder and a hole punch,
made holes in the pages, and clipped them into the ring binder. This
also went onto the top shelf. Later on in the day she would have to
bring in the cookie tin from the den.</P>
<p>
From now on things would be kept neat. And she didn&rsquo;t only mean
in her room. After reading Aristotle, she realized it was just as
important to keep her ideas orderly. She had reserved the top shelf
of the closet especially for that kind of thing. It was the only
place in the room that she did not yet have complete control over.</P>
<p>
There had been no sign of life from her mother for over two hours.
Sophie went downstairs. Before she woke her mother up she decided to
feed her pets.</P>
<p>
She bent over the goldfish bowl in the kitchen. One of the fishes was
black, one orange, and one red and white. This was why she called
them Black Jack, Gold-top, and Red Ridinghood.</P>
<p>
As she sprinkled fish food into the water she said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You belong to Nature&rsquo;s living creatures, you can absorb
nourishment, you can grow and reproduce yourselves. More
specifically, you belong to the animal kingdom. So you can move
around and look out at the world. To be precise, you are fish, and
you breathe through your gills and can swim back and forth in the
waters of life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie put the lid back on the fish food jar. She was quite satisfied
with the way she had placed the goldfish in Nature&rsquo;s scale, and
she was especially pleased with the expression &ldquo;the waters of
life.&rdquo; So now it was the budgerigars&rsquo; turn.</P>
<p>
Sophie poured a little birdseed in their feeding cup and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Dear Smit and Smule. You have become dear little budgerigars
because you grew out of dear little budgerigar eggs, and because
these eggs had the form of being budgerigars, luckily you didn&rsquo;t
grow into squawking parrots.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie then went into the large bathroom, where the sluggish tortoise
lay in a big box. Every now and then when her mother showered, she
yelled that she would kill it one day. But so far it had been an
empty threat. Sophie took a lettuce leaf from a large jam jar and
laid it in the box.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Dear Govinda,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are not one of the
speediest animals, but you certainly are able to sense a tiny
fraction of the great big world we live in. You&rsquo;ll have to
content yourself with the fact that you are not the only one who
can&rsquo;t exceed your own limits.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sherekan was probably out catching mice&mdash;that was a cat&rsquo;s
nature, after all. Sophie crossed the living room toward her mother&rsquo;s
bedroom. A vase of daffodils stood on the coffee table. It was as if
the yellow blooms bowed respectfully as Sophie went by. She stopped
for a moment and let her fingers gently brush their smooth
heads. &ldquo;You belong to the living part of nature too,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Actually, you are quite privileged compared to the vase
you are in. But unfortunately you are not able to appreciate
it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Then Sophie tiptoed into her mother&rsquo;s bedroom. Although
her mother was in a deep sleep, Sophie laid a hand on her forehead.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are one of the luckiest ones,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because
you are not only alive like the lilies of the field. And you are not
only a living creature like Sherekan or Govinda. You are a human, and
therefore have the rare capacity of thought.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What on earth are you talking about, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother had woken up more quickly than usual.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I was just saying that you look like a lazy tortoise. I can
otherwise inform you that I have tidied up my room, with philosophic
thoroughness.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother lifted her head.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will you
put the coffee on?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie did as she was asked, and they were soon sitting in the
kitchen over coffee, juice, and chocolate.</P>
<p>
Suddenly Sophie said, &ldquo;Have you ever wondered why we are alive,
Mom?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, not again!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, because now I know the answer. People live on this planet
so that someone can go around giving names to everything.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that right? I never thought of that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then you have a big problem, because a human is a thinking
animal. If you don&rsquo;t think, you&rsquo;re not really a human.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sophie!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Imagine if there were only vegetables and animals. Then there
wouldn&rsquo;t have been anybody to tell the difference between
&lsquo;cat&rsquo; and &lsquo;dog,&rsquo; or &lsquo;lily&rsquo; and
&lsquo;gooseberry.&rsquo; Vegetables and animals are living too,
but we are the only creatures that can categorize nature into
different groups and classes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You really are the most peculiar girl I have ever had,&rdquo;
said her mother.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I should hope so,&rdquo; said Sophie. &ldquo;Everybody is more
or less peculiar. I am a person, so I am more or less peculiar. You
have only one girl, so I am the most peculiar.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What I meant was that you scare the living daylights out of me
with all that new talk.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are easily scared, then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Later that afternoon Sophie went back to the den. She managed to
smuggle the big cookie tin up to her room without her mother
noticing.</P>
<p>
First she put all the pages in the right order. Then she punched
holes in them and put them in the ring binder, before the chapter on
Aristotle. Finally she numbered each page in the top right-hand
corner. There were in all over fifty pages. Sophie was in the process
of compiling her own book on philosophy. It was not by her, but
written especially for her.</P>
<p>
She had no time to do her homework for Monday. They were probably
going to have a test in Religious Knowledge, but the teacher always
said he valued personal commitment and value judgments. Sophie
felt she was beginning to have a certain basis for both.</P>
<br /><h3>Hellenism</h3><br />
<p>
... a spark from the fire&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Although the philosophy teacher had begun sending his letters
directly to the old hedge, Sophie nevertheless looked in the mailbox
on Monday morning, more out of habit than anything else.</P>
<p>
It was empty, not surprisingly. She began to walk down Clover Close.</P>
<p>
Suddenly she noticed a photograph lying on the sidewalk. It was
a picture of a white jeep and a blue flag with the letters UN on it.
Wasn&rsquo;t that the United Nations flag?</P>
<p>
Sophie turned the picture over and saw that it was a regular
postcard. To &ldquo;Hilde Moller Knag, c/o Sophie Amundsen ...&rdquo;
It had a Norwegian stamp and was postmarked &ldquo;UN Battalion&rdquo;
Friday June 15, 1990.</P>
<p>
June 15! That was Sofie&rsquo;s birthday!</P>
<p>
The card read:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, I assume you are still celebrating your 15th birthday. Or
is this the morning after? Anyway, it makes no difference to
your present. In a sense, that will last a lifetime. But I&rsquo;d
like to wish you a happy birthday one more time. Perhaps you
understand now why I send the cards to Sophie. I am sure she will
pass them on to you.</P>
<p>
P.S. Mom said you had lost your wallet. I hereby promise to reimburse
you the 150 crowns. You will probably be able to get another school
I.D. before they close for the summer vacation. Love from Dad.</P>
<p>
Sophie stood glued to the spot. When was the previous card
postmarked? She seemed to recall that the postcard of the beach was
also postmarked June&mdash;even though it was a whole month off. She
simply hadn&rsquo;t looked properly.</P>
<p>
She glanced at her watch and then ran back to the house. She would
just have to be late for school today!</P>
<p>
Sophie let herself in and leaped upstairs to her room. She found the
first postcard to Hilde under the red silk scarf. Yes! It was also
postmarked June 15! Sophie&rsquo;s birthday and the day before the
summer vacation.</P>
<p>
Her mind was racing as she ran over to the supermarket to meet
Joanna.</P>
<p>
Who was Hilde? How could her father as good as take it for granted
that Sophie would find her? In any case, it was senseless of him to
send Sophie the cards instead of sending them directly to his
daughter. It could not possibly be because he didn&rsquo;t know his
own daughter&rsquo;s address. Was it a practical joke? Was he trying
to surprise his daughter on her birthday by getting a perfect
stranger to play detective and mailman? Was that why she was being
given a month&rsquo;s headstart? And was using her as the go-between
a way of giving his daughter a new girlfriend as a birthday present?
Could she be the present that would &ldquo;last a lifetime&rdquo;?</P>
<p>
If this joker really was in Lebanon, how had he gotten hold of
Sophie&rsquo;s address? Also, Sophie and Hilde had at least two
things in common. If Hilde&rsquo;s birthday was June 15, they were
both born on the same day. And they both had fathers who were on the
other side of the globe.</P>
<p>
Sophie felt she was being drawn into an unnatural world. Maybe it was
not so dumb after all to believe in fate. Still&mdash;she shouldn&rsquo;t
be jumping to conclusions; it could all have a perfectly natural
explanation. But how had Alberto Knox found Hilde&rsquo;s wallet when
Hilde lived in Lillesand? Lillesand was hundreds of miles away. And
why had Sophie found this postcard on her sidewalk? Did it fall out
of the mailman&rsquo;s bag just as he got to Sophie&rsquo;s mailbox?
If so, why should he drop this particular card?</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you completely insane?&rdquo; Joanna burst out when Sophie
finally made it to the supermarket.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna frowned at her severely, like a schoolteacher.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have a good explanation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It has to do with the UN,&rdquo; said Sophie. &ldquo;I was
detained by hostile troops in Lebanon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure ... You&rsquo;re just in love!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They ran to school as fast as their legs could carry them.</P>
<p>
The Religious Knowledge test that Sophie had not had time to prepare
for was given out in the third period. The sheet read:</P>
<br /><h3>PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE AND TOLERANCE</h3><br />
<p>
1. Make a list of things we can know. Then make a list of things we
can only believe.</P>
<p>
2. Indicate some of the factors contributing to a person&rsquo;s
philosophy of life.</P>
<p>
3. What is meant by conscience? Do you think conscience is the same
for everyone?</P>
<p>
4. What is meant by priority of values?</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie sat thinking for a long time before she started to write.
Could she use any of the ideas she had learned from Alberto Knox? She
was going to have to, because she had not opened her Religious
Knowledge book for days. Once she began to write, the words simply
flowed from her pen.</P>
<p>
She wrote that we know the moon is not made of green cheese and that
there are also craters on the dark side of the moon, that both
Socrates and Jesus were sentenced to death, that everybody has
to die sooner or later, that the great temples on the Acropolis were
built after the Persian wars in the fifth century B.C. and that the
most important oracle in ancient Greece was the oracle at Delphi. As
examples of what we can only believe, Sophie mentioned the questions
of whether or not there is life on other planets, whether God exists
or not, whether there is life after death, and whether Jesus was the
son of God or merely a wise man. &ldquo;We can certainly not know
where the world came from,&rdquo; she wrote, completing her
list. &ldquo;The universe can be compared to a large rabbit pulled
out of a top hat. Philosophers try to climb up one of the fine hairs
of the rabbit&rsquo;s fur and stare straight into the eyes of the
Great Magician. Whether they will ever succeed is an open question.
But if each philosopher climbed onto another one&rsquo;s back, they
would get even higher up in the rabbit&rsquo;s fur, and then, in my
opinion, there would be some chance they would make it some day. P.S.
In the Bible there is something that could have been one of the fine
hairs of the rabbit&rsquo;s fur. The hair was called the Tower of
Babel, and it was destroyed because the Magician didn&rsquo;t want
the tiny human insects to crawl up that high out of the white rabbit
he had just created.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Then there was the next question: &ldquo;Indicate some of the factors
contributing to a person&rsquo;s philosophy of life.&rdquo;
Upbringing and environment were important here. People living at the
time of Plato had a different philosophy of life than many
people have today because they lived in a different age and a
different environment. Another factor was the kind of experience
people chose to get themselves. Common sense was not determined by
environment. Everybody had that. Maybe one could compare environment
and social situation with the conditions that existed deep down
in Plato&rsquo;s cave. By using their intelligence individuals can
start to drag themselves up from the darkness. But a journey like
that requires personal courage. Socrates is a good example of a
person who managed to free himself from the prevailing views of his
time by his own intelligence. Finally, she wrote: &ldquo;Nowadays,
people of many lands and cultures are being intermingled more
and more. Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists may live in the same
apartment building. In which case it is more important to accept each
other&rsquo;s beliefs than to ask why everyone does not believe the
same thing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Not bad, thought Sophie. She certainly felt she had covered some
ground with what she had learned from her philosophy teacher. And she
could always supplement it with a dash of her own common sense
and what she might have read and heard elsewhere.</P>
<p>
She applied herself to the third question: &ldquo;What is meant by
conscience? Do you think conscience is the same for everyone?&rdquo;
This was something they had discussed a lot in class. Sophie
wrote: Conscience is people&rsquo;s ability to respond to right
and wrong. My personal opinion is that everyone is endowed with this
ability, so in other words, conscience is innate. Socrates would have
said the same. But just what conscience dictates can vary a lot from
one person to the next. One could say that the Sophists had a point
here. They thought that right and wrong is something mainly
determined by the environment the individual grows up in. Socrates,
on the other hand, believed that conscience is the same for everyone.
Perhaps both views were right. Even if everybody doesn&rsquo;t
feel guilty about showing themselves naked, most people will
have a bad conscience if they are really mean to someone. Still, it
must be remembered that having a conscience is not the same as using
it. Sometimes it looks as if people act quite unscrupulously, but I
believe they also have a kind of conscience somewhere, deep down.
Just as it seems as if some people have no sense at all, but
that&rsquo;s only because they are not using it. P.S. Common sense
and conscience can both be compared to a muscle. If you don&rsquo;t
use a muscle, it gets weaker and weaker.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Now there was only one question left: &ldquo;What is meant by
priority of values?&rdquo; This was another thing they had discussed
a lot lately. For example, it could be of value to drive a car and
get quickly from one place to another. But if driving led to
deforestation and polluting the natural environment, you were
facing a choice of values. After careful consideration Sophie felt
she had come to the conclusion that healthy forests and a pure
environment were more valuable than getting to work quickly. She gave
several more examples. Finally she wrote: &ldquo;Personally, I think
Philosophy is a more important subject than English Grammar. It
would therefore be a sensible priority of values to have Philosophy
on the timetable and cut down a bit on English lessons.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
In the last break the teacher drew Sophie aside.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have already read your Religion test,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
was near the top of the pile.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope it gave you some food for thought.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. It was in
many ways very mature. Surprisingly so. And self-reliant. But had you
done your homework, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie fidgeted a little.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, you did say it was important to have a personal
point of view.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, yes I did ... but there are limits.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie looked him straight in the eye. She felt she could permit
herself this after all she had experienced lately.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have started studying philosophy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
gives one a good background for personal opinions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t make it easy for me to grade your paper.
It will either be a D or an A.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because I was either quite right or quite wrong? Is that what
you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So let&rsquo;s say A,&rdquo; said the teacher. &ldquo;But next
time, do your homework!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
When Sophie got home from school that afternoon, she flung her
schoolbag on the steps and ran down to the den. A brown envelope lay
on top of the gnarled roots. It was quite dry around the edges, so it
must have been a long time since Hermes had dropped it.</P>
<p>
She took the envelope with her and let herself in the front door. She
fed the animals and then went upstairs to her room. Lying on her bed,
she opened Alberto&rsquo;s letter and read:</P>
<br /><h3>HELLENISM</h3><br />
<p>
Here we are again, Sophie! Having read
about the natural philosophers and Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle, you are now familiar with the foundations of European
philosophy. So from now on we will drop the introductory
questions which you earlier received in white envelopes. I
imagine you probably have plenty of other assignments and tests at
school.</P>
<p>
I shall now tell you about the long
period from Aristotle near the end of the fourth century B.C. right
up to the early Middle Ages around A.D. 400. Notice that we can now
write both B.C. and A.D. because Christianity was in fact one of the
most important, and the most mysterious, factors of the period.</P>
<p>
Aristotle died in the year 322 B.C.,
at the time when Athens had lost its dominant role. This was not
least due to the political upheavals resulting from the conquests of
Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.).</P>
<p>
Alexander the Great was the King of
Macedonia. Aristotle was also from Macedonia, and for a time he
was even the young Alexander&rsquo;s tutor. It was Alexander who won
the final, decisive victory over the Persians. And moreover, Sophie,
with his many conquests he linked both Egypt and the Orient as far
east as India to the Greek civilization.</P>
<p>
This marked the beginning of a new
epoch in the history of mankind. A civilization sprang up in which
Greek culture and the Greek language played a leading role. This
period, which lasted for about 300 years, is known as Hellenism. The
term Hellenism refers to both the period of time and the
Greek-dominated culture that prevailed in the three Hellenistic
kingdoms of Macedonia, Syria, and</P>
<p>
Egypt-</P>
<p>
However, from about the year 50 B.C.,
Rome secured the upper hand in military and political affairs. The
new superpower gradually conquered all the Hellenistic kingdoms,
and from then on Roman culture and the Latin language were
predominant from Spain in the west to far into Asia. This was the
beginning of the Roman period, which we often refer to as Late
Antiquity. But remember one thing&mdash;before the Romans managed to
conquer the Hellenistic world, Rome itself was a province of Greek
culture. So Greek culture and Greek philosophy came to play an
important role long after the political influence of the Greeks was a
thing of the past.</P>
<br /><h3>Religion, Philosophy and Science</h3><br />
<p>
Hellenism was characterized by the
fact that the borders between the various countries and cultures
became erased. Previously the Greeks, the Romans, the Egyptians, the
Babylonians, the Syrians, and the Persians had worshipped their
own gods within what we generally call a &ldquo;national religion.&rdquo;
Now the different cultures merged into one great witch&rsquo;s
caldron of religious, philosophical, -and scientific ideas.</P>
<p>
We could perhaps say that the town
square was replaced by the world arena. The old town square had
also buzzed with voices, bringing now different wares to market,
now different thoughts and ideas. The new aspect was that town
squares were being filled with wares and ideas from all over the
world. The voices were buzzing in many different languages.</P>
<p>
We have already mentioned that the
Greek view of life was now much more widespread than it had been in
the former Greek cultural areas. But as time went on, Oriental gods
were also worshipped in all the Mediterranean countries. New
religious formations arose that could draw on the gods and the
beliefs of many of the old nations. This is called syncretism or the
fusion of creeds.</P>
<p>
Prior to this, people had felt a
strong affinity with their own folk and their own city-state. But as
the borders and boundaries became erased, many people began to
experience doubt and uncertainty about their philosophy of life.
Late Antiquity was generally characterized by religious doubts,
cultural dissolution, and pessimism. It was said that &ldquo;the
world has grown old.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
A common feature of the new religious
formations during the Hellenistic period was that they
frequently contained teachings about how mankind could attain
salvation from death. These teachings were often secret. By accepting
the teachings and performing certain rituals, a believer could hope
for the immortality of the soul and eternal life. A certain insight
into the true nature of the universe could be just as important for
the salvation of the soul as religious rituals.</P>
<p>
So much for the new religions, Sophie.
But philosophy was also moving increasingly in the direction of
&ldquo;salvation&rdquo; and serenity. Philosophic insight, it
was now thought, did not only have its own reward; it should also
free mankind from pessimism and the fear of death. Thus the
boundaries between religion and philosophy were gradually eliminated.</P>
<p>
In general, the philosophy of
Hellenism was not star-tlingly original. No new Plato or Aristotle
appeared on the scene. On the contrary, the three great Athenian
philosophers were a source of inspiration to a number of
philosophic trends which I shall briefly describe in a moment.</P>
<p>
Hellenistic science, too, was
influenced by a blend of knowledge from the various cultures. The
town of Alexandria played a key role here as a meeting place
between East and West. While Athens remained the center of
philosophy with still functioning schools of philosophy after Plato
and Aristotle, Alexandria became the center for science. With its
extensive library, it became the center for mathematics, astronomy,
biology, and medicine.</P>
<p>
Hellenistic culture could well be
compared to the world of today. The twentieth century has also been
influenced by an increasingly open civilization. In our own time,
too, this opening out has resulted in tremendous upheavals for
religion and philosophy. And just as in Rome around the beginning of
the Christian era one could come across Greek, Egyptian, and Oriental
religions, today, as we approach the end of the twentieth
century, we can find in all European cities of any size religions
from all parts of the world.</P>
<p>
We also see nowadays how a
conglomeration of old and new religions, philosophies, and sciences
can form the basis of new offers on the &ldquo;view-of-life&rdquo;
market. Much of this &ldquo;new knowledge&rdquo; is actually the
flotsam of old thought, some of whose roots go back to Hellenism.</P>
<p>
As I have said, Hellenistic philosophy
continued to work with the problems raised by Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle. Common to them all was their desire to discover how
mankind should best live and die. They were concerned with
ethics. In the new civilization, this became the central
philosophical project. The main emphasis was on finding out what
true happiness was and how it could be achieved. We are going to look
at four of these philosophical trends.</P>
<br /><h3>The Cynics</h3><br />
<p>
The story goes that one day Socrates
stood gazing at a stall that sold all kinds of wares. Finally he
said, &ldquo;What a lot of things I don&rsquo;t need!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
This statement could be the motto for
the Cynic school of philosophy, founded by Antisthenes in Athens
around 400 B.C.</P>
<p>
Antisthenes had been a pupil of
Socrates, and had become particularly interested in his
frugality.</P>
<p>
The Cynics emphasized that true
happiness is not found in external advantages such as material
luxury, political power, or good health. True happiness lies in not
being dependent on such random and fleeting things. And because
happiness does not consist in benefits of this kind, it is within
everyone&rsquo;s reach. Moreover, having once been attained, it can
never be lost.</P>
<p>
The best known of the Cynics was
Diogenes, a pupil of Antisthenes, who reputedly lived in a barrel and
owned nothing but a cloak, a stick, and a bread bag. (So it wasn&rsquo;t
easy to steal his happiness from him!) One day while he was sitting
beside his barrel enjoying the sun, he was visited by Alexander the
Great. The emperor stood before him and asked if there was anything
he could do for him. Was there anything he desired? &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
Diogenes replied. &ldquo;Stand to one side. You&rsquo;re blocking the
sun.&rdquo; Thus Diogenes showed that he was no less happy and rich
than the great man before him. He had everything he desired.</P>
<p>
The Cynics believed that people did
not need to be concerned about their own health. Even suffering and
death should not disturb them. Nor should they let themselves be
tormented by concern for other people&rsquo;s woes. Nowadays the
terms &ldquo;cynical&rdquo; and &ldquo;cynicism&rdquo; have come to
mean a sneering disbelief in human sincerity, and they imply
insensitivity to other people&rsquo;s suffering.</P>
<br /><h3>The Stoics</h3><br />
<p>
The Cynics were instrumental in the
development of the Stoic school of philosophy, which grew up in
Athens around 300 B.C. Its founder was Zeno, who came originally
from Cyprus and joined the Cynics in Athens after being shipwrecked.
He used to gather his followers under a portico. The name &ldquo;Stoic&rdquo;
comes from the Greek word for portico (stoo). Stoicism was later to
have great significance for Roman culture.</P>
<p>
Like Heraclitus, the Stoics believed
that everyone was a part of the same common sense&mdash;or &ldquo;logos.&rdquo;
They thought that each person was like a world in miniature, or
&ldquo;microcosmos,&rdquo; which is a reflection of the
&ldquo;macro-cosmos.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
This led to the thought that there
exists a universal right-ness, the so-called natural law. And because
this natural law was based on timeless human and universal reason, it
did not alter with time and place. In this, then, the Stoics sided
with Socrates against the Sophists.</P>
<p>
Natural law governed all mankind, even
slaves. The Stoics considered the legal statutes of the various
states merely as incomplete imitations of the &ldquo;law&rdquo;
embedded in nature itself.</P>
<p>
In the same way that the Stoics erased
the difference between the individual and the universe, they also
denied any conflict between &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;matter.&rdquo;
There is only one nature, they averred. This kind of idea is called
monism (in contrast to Plato&rsquo;s clear dualism or two-fold
reality).</P>
<p>
As true children of their time, the
Stoics were distinctly &ldquo;cosmopolitan,&rdquo; in that they were
more receptive to contemporary culture than the &ldquo;barrel
philosophers&rdquo; (the Cynics). They drew attention to human
fellowship, they were preoccupied with politics, and many of them,
notably the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (A.D. 121-180), were active
statesmen. They encouraged Greek culture and philosophy in Rome,
one of the most distinguished of them being the orator, philosopher,
and statesman Cicero (106-43 B.C.). It was he who formed the very
concept of &ldquo;humanism&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a view of life that
has the individual as its central focus. Some years later, the Stoic
Seneca (4 B.C.-A.D. 65) said that &ldquo;to mankind, mankind is
holy.&rdquo; This has remained a slogan for humanism ever since.</P>
<p>
The Stoics, moreover, emphasized that
all natural processes, such as sickness and death, follow the
unbreakable laws of nature. Man must therefore learn to accept his
destiny. Nothing happens accidentally. Everything happens
through necessity, so it is of little use to complain when fate comes
knocking at the door. One must also accept the happy events of life
unperturbed, they thought. In this we see their kinship with the
Cynics, who claimed that all external events were unimportant. Even
today we use the term &ldquo;stoic calm&rdquo; about someone who does
not let his feelings take over.</P>
<br /><h3>The Epicureans</h3><br />
<p>
As we have seen, Socrates was
concerned with finding out how man could live a good life. Both the
Cynics and the Stoics interpreted his philosophy as meaning that man
had to free himself from material luxuries. But Socrates also had a
pupil named Aristippus. He believed that the aim of life was to
attain the highest possible sensory enjoyment. &ldquo;The
highest good is pleasure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the greatest evil is
pain.&rdquo; So he wished to develop a way of life whose aim was to
avoid pain in all forms. (The Cynics and the Stoics believed in
enduring pain of all kinds, which is not the same as setting out to
avoid pain.)</P>
<p>
Around the year 300 B.C., Epicurus
(341-270) founded a school of philosophy in Athens. His followers
were called Epicureans. He developed the pleasure ethic of Aristippus
and combined it with the atom theory of Democritus.</P>
<p>
The story goes that the Epicureans
lived in a garden. They were therefore known as the &ldquo;garden
philosophers.&rdquo; Above the entrance to this garden there is
said to have hung a notice saying, &ldquo;Stranger, here you will
live well. Here pleasure is the highest good.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Epicurus emphasized that the
pleasurable results of an action must always be weighed against its
possible side effects. If you have ever binged on chocolate you know
what I mean. If you haven&rsquo;t, try this exercise: Take all your
saved-up pocket money and buy two hundred crowns&rsquo; worth of
chocolate. (We&rsquo;ll assume you like chocolate.) It is essential
to this exercise that you eat it all at one time. About half an hour
later, when all that delicious chocolate is eaten, you will
understand what Epicurus meant by side effects.</P>
<p>
Epicurus also believed that a
pleasurable result in the short term must be weighed against the
possibility of a greater, more lasting, or more intense pleasure in
the long term. (Maybe you abstain from eating chocolate for a whole
year because you prefer to save up all your pocket money and buy a
new bike or go on an expensive vacation abroad.) Unlike animals,
we are able to plan our lives. We have the ability to make a
&ldquo;pleasure calculation.&rdquo; Chocolate is good, but a new
bike or a trip to England is better.</P>
<p>
Epicurus emphasized, though, that
&ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; does not necessarily mean sensual
pleasure&mdash;like eating chocolate, for instance. Values such
as friendship and the appreciation of art also count. Moreover,
the enjoyment of life required the old Greek ideals of self-control,
temperance, and serenity. Desire must be curbed, and serenity
will help us to endure pain.</P>
<p>
Fear of the gods brought many people
to the garden of Epicurus. In this connection, the atom theory of
Democritus was a useful cure for religious superstitions. In order to
live a good life it is not unimportant to overcome the fear of death.
To this end Epicurus made use of Democritus&rsquo;s theory of the
&ldquo;soul atoms.&rdquo; You may perhaps remember that Democritus
believed there was no life after death because when we die, the &ldquo;soul
atoms&rdquo; disperse in all directions.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Death does not concern us,&rdquo;
Epicurus said quite simply, &ldquo;because as long as we exist,
death is not here. And when it does come, we no longer exist.&rdquo;
(When you think about it, no one has ever been bothered by being
dead.)</P>
<p>
Epicurus summed up his liberating
philosophy with what he called the four medicinal herbs:</P>
<p>
The gods are not to be feared. Death
is nothing to worry about. Good is easy to attain. The fearful is
easy to endure.</P>
<p>
From a Greek point of view, there was
nothing new in comparing philosophical projects with those of medical
science. The intention was simply that man should equip himself with
a &ldquo;philosophic medicine chest&rdquo; containing the four
ingredients I mentioned.</P>
<p>
In contrast to the Stoics, the
Epicureans showed little or no interest in politics and the
community. &ldquo;Live in seclusion!&rdquo; was the advice of
Epicurus. We could perhaps compare his &ldquo;garden&rdquo; with
our present-day communes. There are many people in our own time
who have sought a &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo;&mdash;away from society.</P>
<p>
After Epicurus, many Epicureans
developed an overemphasis on self-indulgence. Their motto was
&ldquo;Live for the moment!&rdquo; The word &ldquo;epicurean&rdquo;
is used in a negative sense nowadays to describe someone who
lives only for pleasure.</P>
<br /><h3>Neoplatonism</h3><br />
<p>
As I showed you, Cynicism, Stoicism,
and Epicureanism all had their roots in the teaching of Socrates.
They also made use of certain of the pre-Socratics like Heraclitus
and Democritus.</P>
<p>
But the most remarkable philosophic
trend in the late Hellenistic period was first and foremost inspired
by Plato&rsquo;s philosophy. We therefore call it Neoplatonism.</P>
<p>
The most important figure in
Neoplatonism was Plotinus (c. 205-270), who studied philosophy in
Alexandria but later settled in Rome. It is interesting to note that
he came from Alexandria, the city that had been the central meeting
point for Greek philosophy and Oriental mysticism for several
centuries. Plotinus brought with him to Rome a doctrine of salvation
that was to compete seriously with Christianity when its time came.
However, Neoplatonism also became a strong influence in mainstream
Christian theology as well.</P>
<p>
Remember Plato&rsquo;s doctrine of
ideas, Sophie, and the way he distinguished between the world of
ideas and the sensory world. This meant establishing a clear division
between the soul and the body. Man thus became a dual creature: our
body consisted of earth and dust like everything else in the
sensory world, but we also had an immortal soul. This was widely
believed by many Greeks long before Plato. Plotinus was also familiar
with similar ideas from Asia.</P>
<p>
Plotinus believed that the world is a
span between two poles. At one end is the divine light which he calls
the One. Sometimes he calls it God. At the other end is absolute
darkness, which receives none of the light from the One. But
Plotinus&rsquo;s point is that this darkness actually has no
existence. It is simply the absence of light&mdash;in other words, it
is not. All that exists is God, or the One, but in the same way that
a beam of light grows progressively dimmer and is gradually
extinguished, there is somewhere a point that the divine glow cannot
reach.</P>
<p>
According to Plotinus, the soul is
illuminated by the light from the One, while matter is the darkness
that has no real existence. But the forms in nature have a faint glow
of the One.</P>
<p>
Imagine a great burning bonfire in the
night from which sparks fly in all directions. A wide radius of light
from the bonfire turns night into day in the immediate area; but the
glow from the fire is visible even from a distance of several miles.
If we went even further away, we would be able to see a tiny speck of
light like a far-off lantern in the dark, and if we went on moving
away, at some point the light would not reach us. Somewhere the rays
of light disappear into the night, and when it is completely
dark we see nothing. There are neither shapes nor shadows.</P>
<p>
Imagine now that reality is a bonfire
like this. That which is burning is God&mdash;and the darkness beyond
is the cold matter that man and animals are made of. Closest to God
are the eternal ideas which are the primal forms of all creatures.
The human soul, above all, is a &ldquo;spark from the fire.&rdquo;
Yet everywhere in nature some of the divine light is shining. We can
see it in all living creatures; even a rose or a bluebell has its
divine glow. Furthest away from the living God are earth and water
and stone.</P>
<p>
I am saying that there is something of
the divine mystery in everything that exists. We can see it sparkle
in a sunflower or a poppy. We sense more of this unfathomable
mystery in a butterfly that flutters from a twig&mdash;or in a
goldfish swimming in a bowl. But we are closest to God in our own
soul. Only there can we become one with the great mystery of life. In
truth, at very rare moments we can experience that we ourselves are
that divine mystery.</P>
<p>
Plotinus&rsquo;s metaphor is rather
like Plato&rsquo;s myth of the cave: the closer we get to the mouth
of the cave, the closer we get to that which all existence springs
from. But in contrast to Plato&rsquo;s clear two-fold reality,
Plotinus&rsquo;s doctrine is characterized by an experience of
wholeness. Everything is one&mdash;for everything is God. Even
the shadows deep down in Plato&rsquo;s cave have a faint glow of the
One.</P>
<p>
On rare occasions in his life,
Plotinus experienced a fusion of his soul with God. We usually call
this a mystical experience. Plotinus is not alone in having had such
experiences. People have told of them at all times and in all
cultures. The details might be different, but the essential features
are the same. Let us take a look at some of these features.</P>
<br /><h3>Mysticism</h3><br />
<p>
A mystical experience is an experience
of merging with God or the &ldquo;cosmic spirit.&rdquo; Many
religions emphasize the gulf between God and Creation, but the mystic
experiences no such gulf. He or she has experienced being &ldquo;one
with God&rdquo; or &ldquo;merging&rdquo; with Him.</P>
<p>
The idea is that what we usually call
&ldquo;I&rdquo; is not the true &ldquo;I.&rdquo; In short glimpses we
can experience an identification with a greater &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Some
mystics call it God, others call it the cosmic spirit, Nature, or the
Universe. When the fusion happens, the mystic feels that he is
&ldquo;losing himself&rdquo;; he disappears into God or is lost
in God in the same way that a drop of water loses itself when it
merges with the sea. An Indian mystic once expressed it in this way:
&ldquo;When I was, God was not. When God is, I am no more.&rdquo; The
Christian mystic Angelus Silesius (1624-1677) put it another way:
Every drop becomes the sea when it flows oceanward, just as at last
the soul ascends and thus becomes the Lord.</P>
<p>
Now you might feel that it cannot be
particularly pleasant to &ldquo;lose oneself.&rdquo; I know what
you mean. But the point is that what you lose is so very much less
than what you gain. You lose yourself only in the form you have at
the moment, but at the same time you realize that you are something
much bigger. You are the universe. In fact, you are the cosmic spirit
itself, Sophie. It is you who are God. If you have to lose yourself
as Sophie Amundsen, you can take comfort in the knowledge that this
&ldquo;everyday I&rdquo; is something you will lose one day anyway.
Your real &ldquo;I&rdquo;&mdash; which you can only experience if you
are able to lose yourself&mdash;is, according to the mystics, like a
mysterious fire that goes on burning to all eternity.</P>
<p>
But a mystical experience like this
does not always come of itself. The mystic may have to seek the path
of &ldquo;purification and enlightenment&rdquo; to his meeting with
God. This path consists of the simple life and various meditation
techniques. Then all at once the mystic achieves his goal, and can
exclaim, &ldquo;I am God&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am You.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Mystical trends are found in all the
great world religions. And the descriptions of mystical
experiences given by the mystics show a remarkable similarity across
all cultural boundaries. It is in the mystic&rsquo;s attempt to
provide a religious or philosophic interpretation of the mystical
experience that his cultural background reveals itself.</P>
<p>
In Western mysticism&mdash;that is,
within Judaism, Christianity, and Islam&mdash;the mystic
emphasizes that his meeting is with a personal God. Although God is
present both in nature and in the human soul, he is also far above
and beyond the world. In Eastern mysticism&mdash;that is, Hinduism,
Buddhism, and Chinese religion&mdash;it is more usual to emphasize
that the mystic experiences a total fusion with God or the &ldquo;cosmic
spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am the cosmic spirit,&rdquo;
the mystic can exclaim, or &ldquo;I am God.&rdquo; For God is not
only present in the world; he has nowhere else to be.</P>
<p>
In India, especially, there have been
strong mystical movements since long before the time of Plato. Swami
Vivekenanda, an Indian who was instrumental in bringing Hinduism to
the west, once said, &ldquo;Just as certain world religions say that
people who do not believe in a personal God outside themselves are
atheists, we say that a person who does not believe in himself is an
atheist. Not believing in the splendor of one&rsquo;s own soul
is what we call atheism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
A mystical experience can also have
ethical significance. A former president of India, Sarvepalli
Radhak-rishnan, said once, &ldquo;Love thy neighbor as thyself
because you ore your neighbor. It is an illusion that makes you think
that your neighbor is someone other than yourself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
People of our own time who do not
adhere to a particular religion also tell of mystical
experiences. They have suddenly experienced something they have
called &ldquo;cosmic consciousness&rdquo; or an &ldquo;oceanic
feeling.&rdquo; They have felt themselves wrenched out of Time and
have experienced the world &ldquo;from the perspective of
eternity.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie sat up in bed. She had to feel whether she still had a body.
As she read more and more about Plato and the mystics, she had begun
to feel as though she were floating around in the room, out of the
window and far off above the town. From there she had looked down on
all the people in the square, and had floated on and on over the
globe that was her home, over the North Sea and Europe, down over the
Sahara and across the African savanna.</P>
<p>
The whole world had become almost like a living person, and it
felt as if that person were Sophie herself. The world is me, she
thought. The great big universe that she had often felt to be
unfathomable and terrifying&mdash;was her own &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Now,
too, the universe was enormous and majestic, but now it was herself
who was so big.</P>
<p>
The extraordinary feeling was fleeting, but Sophie was sure she would
never forget it. It felt as if something inside her had burst through
her forehead and become merged with everything else, the way a drop
of color can tint a whole jug of water.</P>
<p>
When it was all over, it was like waking up with a headache after a
wonderful dream. Sophie registered with a touch of disillusionment
that she had a body which was trying to sit up in bed. Lying on her
stomach reading the pages from Alberto Knox had given her a backache.
But she had experienced something unforgettable.</P>
<p>
Eventually she pulled herself together and stood up. The first thing
she did was to punch holes in the pages and file them in her ring
binder together with the other lessons. Then she .went into the
garden.</P>
<p>
The birds were singing as if the world had just been born. The pale
green of the birches behind the old rabbit hutches was so intense
that it seemed as though the Creator had not yet finished
blending the color.</P>
<p>
Could she really believe that everything was one divine &ldquo;I&rdquo;?
Could she believe that she carried within her a soul that was a
&ldquo;spark from the fire&rdquo;? If it was true, then she was truly
a divine creature.</P>
<br /><h3>The Postcards</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;I&rsquo;m imposing a severe censorship on myself&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Several days went by without any word from the philosophy
teacher. Tomorrow was Thursday, May 17&mdash; Norway&rsquo;s national
day. School would be closed on the 18th as well. As they walked home
after school Joanna suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
camping!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie&rsquo;s immediate reaction was that she couldn&rsquo;t be away
from the house for long. But then she said, &ldquo;Sure, why not?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
A couple of hours later Joanna arrived at Sophie&rsquo;s door with a
large backpack. Sophie had packed hers as well, and she also had the
tent. They both had bedrolls and sweaters, groundsheets and
flashlights, large-size thermos bottles and plenty of their favorite
food.</P>
<p>
When Sophie&rsquo;s mother got home around five o&rsquo;clock, she
gave them a sermon about what they must and must not do. She also
insisted on knowing where they were going to set up camp.</P>
<p>
They told her they intended to make for Grouse Top. They might be
lucky enough to hear the mating call of the grouse next morning.</P>
<p>
Sophie had an ulterior motive for choosing that particular spot.
She thought that Grouse Top must be pretty close to the major&rsquo;s
cabin. Something was urging her to return to it, but she didn&rsquo;t
dare go alone.</P>
<p>
The two girls walked down the path that led from the little
cul-de-sac just beyond Sophie&rsquo;s garden gate. They chatted about
this and that, and Sophie enjoyed taking a little time off from
everything having to do with philosophy.</P>
<p>
By eight o&rsquo;clock they had pitched their tent in a clearing
by Grouse Top. They had prepared themselves for the night and their
bedrolls were unfolded. When they had eaten their sandwiches, Sophie
asked, &ldquo;Have you ever heard of the major&rsquo;s cabin?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The major&rsquo;s cabin?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hut in the woods somewhere near here ... by a
little lake. A strange man lived there once, a major, that&rsquo;s
why it&rsquo;s called the major&rsquo;s cabin.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does anyone live there now?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you want to go and see?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie pointed in among the trees.</P>
<p>
Joanna was not particularly eager, but in the end they set out. The
sun was low in the sky.</P>
<p>
They walked in between the tall pine trees at first, but soon they
were pushing their way through bush and thicket. Eventually they made
their way down to a path. Could it be the path Sophie had followed
that Sunday morning?</P>
<p>
It must have been&mdash;almost at once she could point to something
shining between the trees to the right of the path.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in there,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
They were soon standing at the edge of the small lake. Sophie gazed
at the cabin across the water. All the windows were now
shuttered up. The red building was the most deserted place she had
seen for ages.</P>
<p>
Joanna turned toward her. &ldquo;Do we have to walk on the water?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course not. We&rsquo;ll row.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie pointed down into the reeds. There lay the rowboat, just as
before.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you been here before?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie shook her head. Trying to explain her previous visit would be
far too complicated. And then she would have to tell her friend about
Alberto Knox and the philosophy course as well.</P>
<p>
They laughed and joked as they rowed across the water. When they
reached the opposite bank, Sophie made sure they drew the boat well
up on land.</P>
<p>
They went to the front door. As there was obviously nobody in the
cabin, Joanna tried the door handle.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Locked... you didn&rsquo;t expect it to be open, did you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe we can find a key,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
She began to search in the crevices of the stonework foundation.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go back to the tent instead,&rdquo; said
Joanna after a few minutes.</P>
<p>
But just then Sophie exclaimed, &ldquo;Here it is! I found it!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She held up the key triumphantly. She put it in the lock and the door
swung open.</P>
<p>
The two friends sneaked inside as if they were up to something
criminal. It was cold and dark in the cabin.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t see a thing!&rdquo; said Joanna.</P>
<p>
But Sophie had thought of that. She took a box of matches out of her
pocket and struck one. They only had time to see that the cabin was
deserted before the match went out. Sophie struck another, and this
time she noticed a stump of candle in a wrought-iron candlestick on
top of the stove. She lit it with the third match and the little room
became light enough for them to look around.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it odd that such a small candle can light up so
much darkness?&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
Her friend nodded.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But somewhere the light disappears into the dark,&rdquo;
Sophie went on. &ldquo;Actually, darkness has no existence of its
own. It&rsquo;s only a lack of light.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna shivered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s creepy! Come on, let&rsquo;s
go...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not before we&rsquo;ve looked in the mirror.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie pointed to the brass mirror hanging above the chest of
drawers, just as before.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really pretty!&rdquo; said Joanna.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a magic mirror.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kidding, Joanna. I am sure you can look in it
and see something on the other side.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;ve never been here before? And why is
it so amusing to scare me all the time?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie could not answer that one.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Now it was Joanna who suddenly discovered something lying on the
floor in the corner. It was a small box. Joanna picked it up.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Postcards,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
Sophie gasped.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch them! Do you hear&mdash;don&rsquo;t you dare
touch them!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna jumped. She threw the box down as if she had burnt herself.
The postcards were strewn all over the floor. The next second she
began to laugh.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re only postcards!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna sat down on the floor and started to pick them up. After a
while Sophie sat down beside her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Lebanon ... Lebanon ... Lebanon ... They are all postmarked in
Lebanon,&rdquo; Joanna discovered.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
Joanna sat bolt upright and looked Sophie in the eye.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So you have been here before!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I guess I have.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
It suddenly struck her that it would have been a whole lot easier if
she had just admitted she had been here before. It couldn&rsquo;t do
any harm if she let her friend in on the mysterious things she had
experienced during the last few days.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you before we were here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna began to read the cards.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They are all addressed to someone called Hilde Moller Knag.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie had not touched the cards yet.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What address?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna read: &ldquo;Hilde Moller Knag, c/o Alberto Knox, Lillesand,
Norway.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie breathed a sigh of relief. She was afraid they would say c/o
Sophie Amundsen.</P>
<p>
She began to inspect them more closely.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;April 28 ... May 4 ... May 6 ... May 9 ... They were stamped a
few days ago.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s something else. All the postmarks are
Norwegian! Look at that... UN Battalion ... the stamps are Norwegian
too!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the way they do it. They have to be sort
of neutral, so they have their own Norwegian post office down there.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But how do they get the mail home?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The air force, probably.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie put the candlestick on the floor, and the two friends began to
read the cards. Joanna arranged them in chronological order and read
the first card:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, I can&rsquo;t wait to come home to Lillesand. I expect to
land at Kjevik airport early evening on Midsummer Eve. I would much
rather have arrived in time for your 15th birthday but I&rsquo;m
under military command of course. To make up for it, I promise
to devote all my loving care to the huge present you are getting for
your birthday.</P>
<p>
With love from someone who is always thinking about his daughter&rsquo;s
future.</P>
<p>
P.S. I&rsquo;m sending a copy of this card to our mutual friend.
I know you understand, Hilde. At the moment I&rsquo;m being very
secretive, but you will understand.</P>
<p>
Sophie picked up the next card:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, Down here we take one day at a time. If there is one
thing I&rsquo;m going to remember from these months in Lebanon, it&rsquo;s
all this waiting. But I&rsquo;m doing what I can so you have as great
a 15th birthday as possible. I can&rsquo;t say any more at the
moment. I&rsquo;m imposing a severe censorship on myself. Love,
Dad.</P>
<p>
The two friends sat breathless with excitement. Neither of them
spoke, they just read what was written on the cards:</P>
<p>
My dear child, What I would like best would be to send you my secret
thoughts with a white dove. But they are all out of white doves in
Lebanon. If there is anything this war-torn country needs, it is
white doves. I pray the UN will truly manage to make peace in the
world some day.</P>
<p>
P.S. Maybe your birthday present can be shared with other people.
Let&rsquo;s talk about that when I get home. But you still have no
idea what I&rsquo;m talking about, right? Love from someone who has
plenty of time to think for the both of us.</P>
<p>
When they had read six cards, there was only one left. It read:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, I am now so bursting with all these secrets for your
birthday that I have to stop myself several times a day from calling
home and blowing the whole thing. It is something that simply grows
and grows. And as you know, when a thing gets bigger and bigger it&rsquo;s
more difficult to keep it to yourself. Love from Dad.</P>
<p>
P.S. Some day you will meet a girl called Sophie. To give you both a
chance to get to know more about each other before you meet, I have
begun sending her copies of all the cards I send to you. I expect she
will soon begin to catch on, Hilde. As yet she knows no more than
you. She has a girlfriend called Joanna. Maybe site can be of
help?</P>
<p>
After reading the last card, Joanna and Sophie sat quite still
staring wildly at each other. Joanna was holding Sophie&rsquo;s
wrist in a tight grip.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When was the last card stamped?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie looked again at the card.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;May 16,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s today.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; cried Joanna, almost angrily.</P>
<p>
They examined the postmark carefully, but there was no mistaking
it... 05-16-90.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; insisted Joanna. &ldquo;And I
can&rsquo;t imagine who could have written it. It must be someone who
knows us. But how could they know we would come here on this
particular day?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna was by far the more scared of the two. The business with Hilde
and her father was nothing new to Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think it has something to do with the brass mirror.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna jumped again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t actually think the cards come fluttering out
of the mirror the minute they are stamped in Lebanon?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you have a better explanation?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie got to her feet and held the candle up in front of the two
portraits on the wall. Joanna came over and peered at the pictures.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Berkeley and Bjerkely. What does that mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The candle was almost burnt down.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; said Joanna. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We must just take the mirror with us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie reached up and unhooked the large brass mirror from the
wall above the chest of drawers. Joanna tried to stop her but Sophie
would not be deterred.</P>
<p>
When they got outside it was as dark as a May night can get. There
was enough light in the sky for the clear outlines of bushes and
trees to be visible. The small lake lay like a reflection of the sky
above it. The two girls rowed pensively across to the other side.</P>
<p>
Neither of them spoke much on the way back to the tent, but each knew
that the other was thinking intensely about what they had seen. Now
and then a frightened bird would start up, and a couple of times they
heard the hooting of an owl.</P>
<p>
As soon as they reached the tent, they crawled into their bedrolls.
Joanna refused to have the mirror inside the tent. Before they fell
asleep, they agreed that it was scary enough, knowing it was just
outside the tent flap. Sophie had also taken the postcards and put
them in one of the pockets of her backpack.</P>
<p>
They woke early next morning. Sophie was up first. She put her boots
on and went outside the tent. There lay the large mirror in the
grass, covered with dew.</P>
<p>
Sophie wiped the dew off with her sweater and gazed down at her own
reflection. It was as if she was looking down and up at herself at
the same time. Luckily she found no early morning postcard from
Lebanon.</P>
<p>
Above the broad clearing behind the tent a ragged morning mist was
drifting slowly into little wads of cotton. Small birds were
chirping energetically but Sophie could neither see nor hear any
grouse.</P>
<p>
The girls put on extra sweaters and ate their breakfast outside the
tent. Their conversation soon turned to the major&rsquo;s cabin and
the mysterious cards.</P>
<p>
After breakfast they folded up the tent and set off for home. Sophie
carried the large mirror under her arm. From time to time she had to
rest&mdash;Joanna refused to touch it.</P>
<p>
As they approached the outskirts of the town they heard a few
sporadic shots. Sophie recalled what Hilde&rsquo;s father had written
about war-torn Lebanon, and she realized how lucky she was to
have been born in a peaceful country. The &ldquo;shots&rdquo;
they heard came from innocent fireworks celebrating the national
holiday.</P>
<p>
Sophie invited Joanna in for a cup of hot chocolate. Her mother was
very curious to know where they had found the mirror. Sophie told her
they had found it outside the major&rsquo;s cabin, and her
mother repeated the story about nobody having lived there for many
years.</P>
<p>
When Joanna had gone, Sophie put on a red dress. The rest of the
Norwegian national day passed quite normally. In the evening,
the TV news had a feature on how the Norwegian UN battalion had
celebrated the day in Lebanon. Sophie&rsquo;s eyes were glued to the
screen. One of the men she was seeing could be Hilde&rsquo;s father.</P>
<p>
The last thing Sophie did on May 17 was to hang the large mirror on
the wall in her room. The following morning there was a new brown
envelope in the den. She tore it open at once and began to read.</P>
<br /><h3>Two Cultures</h3><br />
<p>
... the only way to avoid floating in a vacuum &hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
It won&rsquo;t be long now before we
meet, my dear Sophie. I thought you would return to the major&rsquo;s
cabin&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I left all the cards from Hilde&rsquo;s
father there. That was the only way they could be delivered to her.
Don&rsquo;t worry about how she will get them. A lot can happen
before June 15.</P>
<p>
We have seen how the Hellenistic
philosophers recycled the ideas of earlier philosophers. Some
even attempted to turn their predecessors into religious
prophets. Plotinus came close to acclaiming Plato as the savior of
humanity.</P>
<p>
But as we know, another savior was
born during the period we have just been discussing&mdash;and that
happened outside the Greco-Roman area. I refer to Jesus of Nazareth.
In this chapter we will see how Christianity gradually began to
permeate the Greco-Roman world&mdash;more or less the same way that
Hilde&rsquo;s world has gradually begun to permeate ours.</P>
<p>
Jesus was a jew, and the Jews belong
to Semitic culture. The Greeks and the Romans belong to Indo-European
culture. European civilization has its roots in both cultures.
But before we take a closer look at the way Christianity influenced
Greco-Roman culture, we must examine these roots.</P>
<p>
THE INDO-EUROPEANS</P>
<p>
By Indo-European we mean all the
nations and cultures that use Indo-European languages. This covers
all European nations except those whose inhabitants speak one of
the Finno-Ugrian languages (Lapp, Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian)
or Basque. In addition, most Indian and Iranian languages belong to
the Indo-European family of languages.</P>
<p>
About 4,000 years ago, the primitive
Indo-Europeans lived in areas bordering on the Black Sea and the
Caspian Sea. From there, waves of these Indo-European tribes
began to wander southeast into Iran and India, southwest to Greece,
Italy, and Spain, westward through Central Europe to France and
Britain, northwestward to Scandinavia and northward to Eastern
Europe and Russia. Wherever they went, the Indo-Europeans assimilated
with the local culture, although Indo-European languages and
Indo-European religion came to play a dominant role.</P>
<p>
The ancient Indian Veda scriptures and
Greek philosophy, and for that matter Snorri Sturluson&rsquo;s
mythology are all written in related languages. But it is not only
the languages that are related. Related languages often lead to
related ideas. This is why we usually speak of an Indo-European
&ldquo;culture.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The culture of the Indo-Europeans was
influenced most of all by their belief in many gods. This is called
polytheism. The names of these gods as well as much of the
religious terminology recur throughout the whole Indo-European
area. I&rsquo;ll give you a few examples:</P>
<p>
The ancient Indians worshipped the
celestial god Dyaus, which in Sanskrit means the sky, day, heaven/
Heaven. In Greek this god is called Zeus, in Latin, Jupiter (actually
iov-pater, or &ldquo;Father Heaven&rdquo;), and in Old Norse, Tyr. So
the names Dyaus, Zeus, lov, and Tyr are dialectal variants of the
same word.</P>
<p>
You probably learned that the old
Vikings believed in gods which they called Aser. This is another word
we find recurring all over the Indo-European area. In Sanskrit, the
ancient classical language of India, the gods are called asura and in
Persian Ahura. Another word for &ldquo;god&rdquo; is deva in
Sanskrit, claeva in Persian, deus in Latin and tivurr in Old Norse.</P>
<p>
In Viking times, people also believed
in a special group of fertility gods (such as Niord, Freyr, and
Freyja). These gods were referred to by a special collective name,
vaner, a word that is related to the Latin name for the goddess of
fertility, Venus. Sanskrit has the related word van/, which means
&ldquo;desire.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
There is also a clear affinity to be
observed in some of the Indo-European myths. In Snorri&rsquo;s
stories of the Old Norse gods, some of the myths are similar to the
myths of India that were handed down from two to three thousand years
earlier. Although Snorri&rsquo;s myths reflect the Nordic environment
and the Indian myths reflect the Indian, many of them retain traces
of a common origin. We can see these traces most clearly in myths
about immortal potions and the struggles of the gods against the
monsters of chaos.</P>
<p>
We can also see clear similarities in
modes of thought across the Indo-European cultures. A typical
likeness is the way the world is seen as being the subject of a drama
in which the forces of Good and Evil confront each other in a
relentless struggle. Indo-Europeans have therefore often tried to
&ldquo;predict&rdquo; how the battles between Good and Evil will turn
out.</P>
<p>
One could say with some truth that it
was no accident that Greek philosophy originated in the Indo-European
sphere of culture. Indian, Greek, and Norse mythology all have
obvious leanings toward a philosophic, or &ldquo;speculative,&rdquo;
view of the world.</P>
<p>
The Indo-Europeans sought &ldquo;insight&rdquo;
into the history of the world. We can even trace a particular word
for &ldquo;insight&rdquo; or &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; from one
culture to another all over the Indo-European world. In Sanskrit it
is vidya. The word is identical to the Greek word idea, which was so
important in Plato&rsquo;s philosophy. From Latin, we have the word
video, but on Roman ground the word simply means to see. For us, &ldquo;I
see&rdquo; can mean &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; and in the cartoons,
a light bulb can flash on above Woody Woodpecker&rsquo;s head when he
gets a bright idea. (Not until our own day did &ldquo;seeing&rdquo;
become synonymous with staring at the TV screen.) In English we know
the words wise and wisdom&mdash;in German, wissen (to know).
Norwegian has the word viten, which has the same root as the
Indian word vidya, the Greek idea, and the Latin video.</P>
<p>
All in all, we can establish that
sight was the most important of the senses for Indo-Europeans. The
literature of Indians, Greeks, Persians, and Teutons alike was
characterized by great cosmic visions. (There is that word
again: &ldquo;vision&rdquo; comes from the Latin verb &ldquo;video.&rdquo;}
It was also characteristic for Indo-European culture to make pictures
and sculptures of the gods and of mythical events.</P>
<p>
Lastly, the Indo-Europeans had a
cyc//c view of history. This is the belief that history goes in
circles, just like the seasons of the year. There is thus no
beginning and no end to history, but there are different
civilizations that rise and fall in an eternal interplay between
birth and death.</P>
<p>
Both of the two great Oriental
religions, Hinduism and Buddhism, are Indo-European in origin. So is
Greek philosophy, and we can see a number of clear parallels
between Hinduism and Buddhism on the one hand and Greek
philosophy on the other. Even today, Hinduism and Buddhism are
strongly imbued with philosophical reflection.</P>
<p>
Not infrequently we find in Hinduism
and Buddhism an emphasis on the fact that the deity is present in all
things (pantheism) and that man can become one with God through
religious insight. (Remember Plotinus, Sophie?) To achieve this
requires the practice of deep self-communion or meditation. Therefore
in the Orient, passivity and seclusion can be religious ideals.
In ancient Greece, too, there were many people who believed in an
ascetic, or religiously secluded, way of life for the salvation of
the soul Many aspects of medieval monastic life can be traced back to
beliefs dating from the Greco-Roman civilization.</P>
<p>
Similarly, the transmigration of the
soul, or the cycle of rebirth, is a fundamental belief in many
Indo-European cultures. For more than 2,500 years, the ultimate
purpose of life for every Indian has been the release from the cycle
of rebirth. Plato also believed in the transmigration of the soul.</P>
<br /><h3>The Semites</h3><br />
<p>
Let us now turn to the Semites,
Sophie. They belong to a completely different culture with a
completely different language. The Semites originated in the Arabian
Peninsula, but they also migrated to different parts of the world.
The Jews lived far from their home for more than 2,000 years. Semitic
history and religion reached furthest away from its roots by way of
Christendom, although Semitic culture also became widely spread via
Islam.</P>
<p>
All three Western religions&mdash;Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam&mdash;share a Semitic background. The
Muslims&rsquo; holy scripture, the Koran, and the Old Testament were
both written in the Semitic family of languages. One of the Old
Testament words for &ldquo;god&rdquo; has the same semantic root as
the Muslim Allah. (The word &ldquo;allah&rdquo; means, quite simply,
&ldquo;god.&rdquo;)</P>
<p>
When we get to Christianity the
picture becomes more complicated. Christianity also has a Semitic
background, but the New Testament was written in Greek, and when the
Christian theology or creed was formulated, it was influenced by
Greek and Latin, and thus also by Hellenistic philosophy.</P>
<p>
The Indo-Europeans believed in many
different gods. It was just as characteristic for the Semites that
from earliest times they were united in their belief in one God. This
is called monotheism. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all share the
same fundamental idea that there is only one God.</P>
<p>
The Semites also had in common a
linear view of history. In other words, history was seen as an
ongoing line. In the beginning God created the world and that was the
beginning of history. But one day history will end and that will be
Judgment Day, when God judges the living and the dead.</P>
<p>
The role played by history is an
important feature of these three Western religions. The belief is
that God intervenes in the course of history&mdash;even that
history exists in order that God may manifest his will in the world,
just as he once led Abraham to the &ldquo;Promised Land,&rdquo; he
leads mankind&rsquo;s steps through history to the Day of Judgment.
When that day comes, all evil in the world will be destroyed.</P>
<p>
With their strong emphasis on God&rsquo;s
activity in the course of history, the Semites were preoccupied with
the writing of history for many thousands of years. And these
historical roots constitute the very core of their holy scriptures.</P>
<p>
Even today the city of Jerusalem is a
significant religious center for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.
This indicates something of the common background of these three
religions.</P>
<p>
The city comprises prominent (Jewish)
synagogues, (Christian) churches, and (Islamic) mosques. It is
therefore deeply tragic that Jerusalem should have become a bone of
contention&mdash;with people killing each other by the thousand
because they cannot agree on who is to have ascendancy over this
&ldquo;Eternal City.&rdquo; May the UN one day succeed in making
Jerusalem a holy shrine for all three religions! (We shall not go any
further into this more practical part of our philosophy course
for the moment. We will leave it entirely to Hilde&rsquo;s father.
You must have gathered by now that he is a UN observer in
Lebanon. To be more precise, I can reveal that he is serving as a
major. If you are beginning to see some connection, that&rsquo;s
quite as it should be. On the other hand, let&rsquo;s not anticipate
events!)</P>
<p>
We said that the most important of the
senses for Indo-Europeans was sight. How important hearing was to the
Semitic cultures is just as interesting. It is no accident that the
Jewish creed begins with the words: &ldquo;Hear, O Israel!&rdquo; In
the Old Testament we read how the people &ldquo;heard&rdquo; the word
of the Lord, and the Jewish prophets usually began their sermons
with the words: &ldquo;Thus spake Jehovah (God).&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hearing&rdquo; the word of God
is also emphasized in Christianity. The religious ceremonies of
Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are all characterized by reading
aloud or &ldquo;reciting.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
I also mentioned that the
Indo-Europeans always made pictorial representations or sculptures of
their gods. It was just as characteristic for the Semites that they
never did. They were not supposed to create pictures or sculptures of
God or the &ldquo;deity.&rdquo; The Old Testament commands that the
people shall not make any image of God. This is still law today both
for Judaism and Islam. Within Islam there is moreover a general
aversion to both photography and art, because people should not
compete with God in &ldquo;creating&rdquo; anything.</P>
<p>
But the Christian churches are full of
pictures of Jesus and God, you are probably thinking. True enough,
Sophie, but this is just one example of how Christendom was
influenced by the Greco-Roman world. (In the Greek Orthodox
Church&mdash;that is, in Greece and in Russia&mdash; &ldquo;graven
images,&rdquo; or sculptures and crucifixes, from Bible stories are
still forbidden.)</P>
<p>
In contrast to the great religions of
the Orient, the three Western religions emphasize that there is a
distance between God and his creation. The purpose is not to be
released from the cycle of rebirth, but to be redeemed from sin and
blame. Moreover, religious life is characterized more by prayer,
sermons, and the study of the scriptures than by self-communion
and meditation.</P>
<br /><h3>Israel</h3><br />
<p>
I have no intention of competing with
your religion teacher, Sophie, but let us just make a quick summary
of Christianity&rsquo;s Jewish background.</P>
<p>
It all began when God created the
world. You can read how that happened on the very first page of the
Bible. Then mankind began to rebel against God. Their punishment
was not only that Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden of
Eden&mdash;Death also came into the world.</P>
<p>
Man&rsquo;s disobedience to God is a
theme that runs right through the Bible. If we go further on in the
Book of Genesis we read about the Flood and Noah&rsquo;s Ark.
Then we read that God made a covenant with Abraham and his seed. This
covenant&mdash;or pact&mdash;was that Abraham and all his seed would
keep the Lord&rsquo;s commandments. In exchange God promised to
protect all the children of Abraham. This covenant was renewed when
Moses was given the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai around the year
1200 B.C. At that time the Israelites had long been held as slaves in
Egypt, but with God&rsquo;s help they were led back to the land of
Israel.</P>
<p>
About 1,000 years before Christ&mdash;and
therefore long before there was anything called Greek philosophy&mdash;we
hear of three great kings of Israel. The first was Saul, then came
David, and after him came Solomon. Now all the Israelites were united
in one kingdom, and under King David, especially, they experienced a
period of political, military, and cultural glory.</P>
<p>
When kings were chosen, they were
anointed by the people. They thus received the title Messiah, which
means &ldquo;the anointed one.&rdquo; In a religious sense kings were
looked upon as a go-between between God and his people. The king
could therefore also be called the &ldquo;Son of God&rdquo; and the
country could be called the &ldquo;Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
But before long Israel began to lose
its power and the kingdom was divided into a Northern kingdom
(Israel) and a Southern kingdom (Judea). In 722 B.C. the Northern
kingdom was conquered by the Assyrians and it lost all political and
religious significance. The Southern kingdom fared no better, being
conquered by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. Its temple was destroyed and
most of its people were carried off to slavery in Babylon. This
&ldquo;Babylonian captivity&rdquo; lasted until 539 B.C. when the
people were permitted to return to Jerusalem, and the great
temple was restored. But for the rest of the period before the birth
of Christ the Jews continued to live under foreign domination.</P>
<p>
The question Jews constantly asked
themselves was why the Kingdom of David was destroyed and why
catastrophe after catastrophe rained down on them, for God had
promised to hold Israel in his hand. But the people had also promised
to keep God&rsquo;s commandments. It gradually became widely accepted
that God was punishing Israel for her disobedience.</P>
<p>
From around 750 B.C. various prophets
began to come forward preaching God&rsquo;s wrath over Israel for not
keeping his commandments. One day God would hold a Day of
Judgment over Israel, they said. We call prophecies like these
Doomsday prophecies.</P>
<p>
In the course of time there came other
prophets who preached that God would redeem a chosen few of his
people and send them a &ldquo;Prince of Peace&rdquo; or a king of the
House of David. He would restore the old Kingdom of David and the
people would have a future of prosperity.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The people that walked in
darkness will see a great light,&rdquo; said the prophet Isaiah, and
&ldquo;they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
hath the light shined.&rdquo; We call prophecies like these
prophecies of redemption.</P>
<p>
To sum up: The children of Israel
lived happily under King David. But later on when their situation
deteriorated, their prophets began to proclaim that there would one
day come a new king of the House of David. This &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Son of God,&rdquo; would &ldquo;redeem&rdquo; the people,
restore Israel to greatness, and found a &ldquo;Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>Jesus</h3><br />
<p>
I assume you are still with me,
Sophie? The key words are &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; &ldquo;Son of God,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Kingdom of God.&rdquo; At first it was all taken
politically. In the time of Jesus, there were a lot of people who
imagined that there would come a new &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; in the
sense of a political, military, and religious leader of the caliber
of King David. This &ldquo;savior&rdquo; was thus looked upon as a
national deliverer who would put an end to the suffering of the Jews
under Roman domination.</P>
<p>
Well and good. But there were also
many people who were more farsighted. For the past two hundred years
there had been prophets who believed that the promised &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;
would be the savior of the whole world. He would not simply free the
Israelites from a foreign yoke, he would save all mankind from sin
and blame&mdash;and not least, from death. The longing for
&ldquo;salvation&rdquo; in the sense of redemption was widespread all
over the Hellenistic world.</P>
<p>
So along comes Jesus of Nazareth. He
was not the only man ever to have come forward as the promised
&ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo; Jesus also uses the words &ldquo;Son of God,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Kingdom of God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;redemption.&rdquo;
In doing this he maintains the link with the old prophets. He rides
into Jerusalem and allows himself to be acclaimed by the crowds
as the savior of the people, thus playing directly on the way the old
kings were installed in a characteristic &ldquo;throne accession
ritual.&rdquo; He also allows himself to be anointed by the people.
&ldquo;The time is fulfilled,&rdquo; he says, and &ldquo;the Kingdom
of God is at hand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
But here is a very important point:
Jesus distinguished himself from the other &ldquo;messiahs&rdquo; by
stating clearly that he was not a military or political rebel. His
mission was much greater. He preached salvation and God&rsquo;s
forgiveness for everyone. To the people he met on his way he
said &ldquo;Your sins are forgiven you for his name&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Handing out the &ldquo;remission of
sins&rdquo; in this way was totally unheard of. And what was even
worse, he addressed God as &ldquo;Father&rdquo; (Abba). This was
absolutely unprecedented in the Jewish community at that time.
It was therefore not long before there arose a wave of protest
against him among the scribes.</P>
<p>
So here was the situation: a great
many people at the time of Jesus were waiting for a Messiah who would
reestablish the Kingdom of God with a great flourish of
trumpets (in other words, with fire and sword). The expression
&ldquo;Kingdom of God&rdquo; was indeed a recurring theme in the
preachings of Jesus&mdash;but in a much broader sense. Jesus said
that the &ldquo;Kingdom of God&rdquo; is loving thy neighbor,
compassion for the weak and the poor, and forgiveness of those who
have erred.</P>
<p>
This was a dramatic shift in the
meaning of an age-old expression with warlike overtones. People were
expecting a military leader who would soon proclaim the
establishment of the Kingdom of God, and along comes Jesus in
kirtle and sandals telling them that the Kingdom of God&mdash; or the
&ldquo;new covenant&rdquo;&mdash;is that you must &ldquo;love thy
neighbor as thyself.&rdquo; But that was not all, Sophie, he
also said that we must love our enemies. When they strike us, we must
not retaliate; we must even turn the other cheek. And we must
forgive&mdash;not seven times but seventy times seven.</P>
<p>
Jesus himself demonstrated that he was
not above talking to harlots, corrupt usurers, and the politically
subversive. But he went even further: he said that a
good-for-nothing who has squandered all his father&rsquo;s
inheritance&mdash; or a humble publican who has pocketed official
funds&mdash; is righteous before God when he repents and prays for
forgiveness, so great is God&rsquo;s mercy.</P>
<p>
But hang on&mdash;he went a step
further: Jesus said that such sinners were more righteous in the eyes
of God and more deserving of God&rsquo;s forgiveness than the
spotless Pharisees who went around flaunting their virtue.</P>
<p>
Jesus pointed out that nobody can earn
God&rsquo;s mercy. We cannot redeem ourselves (as many of the Greeks
believed). The severe ethical demands made by Jesus in the
Sermon on the Mount were not only to teach what the will of God
meant, but also to show that no man is righteous in the eyes of God.
God&rsquo;s mercy is boundless, but we have to turn to God and pray
for his forgiveness.</P>
<p>
I shall leave a more thorough study of
Jesus and his teachings to your religion teacher. He will have quite
a task. I hope he will succeed in showing what an exceptional
man Jesus was. In an ingenious way he used the language of his time
to give the old war cries a totally new and broader content. It&rsquo;s
not surprising that he ended on the Cross. His radical tidings of
redemption were at odds with so many interests and power factors that
he had to be removed.</P>
<p>
When we talked about Socrates, we saw
how dangerous it could be to appeal to people&rsquo;s reason.
With Jesus we see how dangerous it can be to demand unconditional
brotherly love and unconditional forgiveness. Even in the world of
today we can see how mighty powers can come apart at the seams when
confronted with simple demands for peace, love, food for the poor,
and amnesty for the enemies of the state.</P>
<p>
You may recall how incensed Plato was
that the most righteous man in Athens had to forfeit his life.
According to Christian teachings, Jesus was the only righteous
person who ever lived. Nevertheless he was condemned to death.
Christians say he died for the sake of humanity. This is what
Christians usually call the &ldquo;Passion&rdquo; of Christ Jesus was
the &ldquo;suffering servant&rdquo; who bore the sins of humanity in
order that we could be &ldquo;atoned&rdquo; and saved from God&rsquo;s
wrath.</P>
<br /><h3>Paul</h3><br />
<p>
A few days after Jesus had been
crucified and buried, rumors spread that he had risen from the grave.
He thereby proved that he was no ordinary man. He truly was the &ldquo;Son
of God.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
We could say that the Christian Church
was founded on Easter Morning with the rumors of the resurrection of
Jesus. This is already established by Paul: &ldquo;And if Christ be
not risen, then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Now all mankind could hope for the
resurrection of the body, for it was to save us that Jesus was
crucified. But, dear Sophie, remember that from a Jewish point of
view there was no question of the &ldquo;immortality of the soul&rdquo;
or any form of &ldquo;transmigration&rdquo;; that was a Greek&mdash;and
therefore an Indo-European&mdash;thought. According to Christianity
there is nothing in man&mdash;no &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; for example&mdash;
that is in itself immortal. Although the Christian Church believes in
the &ldquo;resurrection of the body and eternal life,&rdquo; it is by
God&rsquo;s miracle that we are saved from death and &ldquo;damnation.&rdquo;
It is neither through our own merit nor through any natural&mdash;or
innate&mdash;ability.</P>
<p>
So the early Christians began to
preach the &ldquo;glad tidings&rdquo; of salvation through faith
in Jesus Christ. Through his mediation, the &ldquo;Kingdom of God&rdquo;
was about to become a reality. Now the entire world could be won
for Christ. (The word &ldquo;christ&rdquo; is a Greek translation of
the Hebrew word &ldquo;messiah,&rdquo; the anointed one.)</P>
<p>
A few years after the death of Jesus,
the Pharisee Paul converted to Christianity. Through his many
missionary journeys across the whole of the Greco-Roman world he made
Christianity a worldwide religion. We hear of this in the Acts of the
Apostles. Paul&rsquo;s preaching and guidance for the Christians is
known to us from the many epistles written by him to the early
Christian congregations.</P>
<p>
He then turns up in Athens. He wanders
straight into the city square of the philosophic capital. And it is
said that &ldquo;his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city
wholly given to idolatry.&rdquo; He visited the Jewish synagogue
in Athens and conversed with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers. They
took him up to the Areopagos hill and asked him: &ldquo;May we know
what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? For thou bringest
certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what
these things mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Can you imagine it, Sophie? A Jew
suddenly appears in the Athenian marketplace and starts talking about
a savior who was hung on a cross and later rose from the grave. Even
from this visit of Paul in Athens we sense a coming collision between
Greek philosophy and the doctrine of Christian redemption. But
Paul clearly succeeds in getting the Athenians to listen to him. From
the Areopagos&mdash;and beneath the proud temples of the
Acropolis&mdash; he makes the following speech:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ye men of Athens, I perceive
that in all things ye are too superstitious. For as I passed by, and
beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE
UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto
you.</P>
<p>
God that made the world and all things
therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in
temples made with hands; neither is worshipped with men&rsquo;s
hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life,
and breath, and all things. And hath made of one blood all nations of
men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined
the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that
they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him and
find him, though he be not far from every one of us. For in him we
live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets
have said, For we are also his offspring. Forasmuch then as we are
the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like
unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man&rsquo;s device.
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all
men everywhere to repent:</P>
<p>
Because he hath appointed a day, in
the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom
he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men,
in that he hath raised him from the dead.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Paul in Athens, Sophie! Christianity
has begun to penetrate the Greco-Roman world as something else,
something completely different from Epicurean, Stoic, or Neoplatonic
philosophy. But Paul nevertheless finds some common ground in this
culture. He emphasizes that the search for God is natural to all men.
This was not new to the Greeks. But what was new in Paul&rsquo;s
preaching is that God has also revealed himself to mankind and
has in truth reached out to them. So he is no longer a &ldquo;philosophic
God&rdquo; that people can approach with their understanding. Neither
is he &ldquo;an image of gold or silver or stone&rdquo;&mdash;there
were plenty of those both on the Acropolis and down in the
marketplace! He is a God that &ldquo;dwelleth not in temples made
with hands.&rdquo; He is a personal God who intervenes in the course
of history and dies on the Cross for the sake of mankind.</P>
<p>
When Paul had made his speech on the
Areopagos, we read in the Acts of the Apostles, some mocked him for
what he said about the resurrection from the dead. But others said:
&ldquo;We will hear thee again of this matter.&rdquo; There were
also some who followed Paul and began to believe in
Christianity. One of them, it is worth noting, was a woman named
Damaris. Women were amongst the most fervent converts to
Christianity.</P>
<p>
So Paul continued his missionary
activities. A few decades after the death of Jesus, Christian
congregations were already established in all the important Greek and
Roman cities&mdash;in Athens, in Rome, in Alexandria, in Ephesos, and
in Corinth. In the space of three to four hundred years, the entire
Hellenistic world had become Christian.</P>
<br /><h3>The Creed</h3><br />
<p>
It was not only as a missionary that
Paul came to have a fundamental significance for Christianity. He
also had great influence within the Christian congregations. There
was a widespread need for spiritual guidance.</P>
<p>
One important question in the early
years after Jesus was whether non-Jews could become Christians
without first becoming Jews. Should a Greek, for instance, observe
the dietary laws? Paul believed it to be unnecessary. Christianity
was more than a Jewish sect. It addressed itself to everybody in a
universal message of salvation. The &ldquo;Old Covenant&rdquo;
between God and Israel had been replaced by the &ldquo;New Covenant&rdquo;
which Jesus had established between God and mankind.</P>
<p>
However, Christianity was not the only
religion at that time. We have seen how Hellenism was influenced by a
fusion of religions. It was thus vitally necessary for the church to
step forward with a concise summary of the Christian doctrine, both
in order to distance itself from other religions and to prevent
schisms within the Christian Church. Therefore the first Creed was
established, summing up the central Christian &ldquo;dogmas&rdquo;
or tenets.</P>
<p>
One such central tenet was that Jesus
was both God and man. He was not the &ldquo;Son of God&rdquo; on the
strength of his actions alone. He was God himself. But he was also a
&ldquo;true man&rdquo; who had shared the misfortunes of mankind and
actually suffered on the Cross.</P>
<p>
This may sound like a contradiction.
But the message of the church was precisely that God became man.
Jesus was not a &ldquo;demigod&rdquo; (which was half man, half god).
Belief in such &ldquo;demigods&rdquo; was quite widespread in Greek
and Hellenistic religions. The church taught that Jesus was &ldquo;perfect
God, perfect man.&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>Postscript</h3><br />
<p>
Let me try to say a few words about
how all this hangs together, my dear Sophie. As Christianity makes
its entry into the Greco-Roman world we are witnessing a dramatic
meeting of two cultures. We are also seeing one of history&rsquo;s
great cultural revolutions.</P>
<p>
We are about to step out of antiquity.
Almost one thousand years have passed since the days of the
early Greek philosophers. Ahead of us we have the Christian Middle
Ages, which also lasted for about a thousand years.</P>
<p>
The German poet Goethe once said that
&ldquo;he who cannot draw on three thousand years is living from
hand to mouth.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t want you to end up in such a sad
state. I will do what I can to acquaint you with your historical
roots. It is the only way to become a human being. It is the only way
to become more than a naked ape. It is the only way to avoid floating
in a vacuum.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is the only way to become a
human being. It is the only way to become more than a naked ape ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie sat for a while staring into
the garden through the little holes in the hedge. She was beginning
to understand why it was so important to know about her
historical roots. It had certainly been important to the Children of
Israel.</P>
<p>
She herself was just an ordinary
person. But if she knew her historical roots, she would be a little
less ordinary.</P>
<p>
She would not be living on this planet
for more than a few years. But if the history of mankind was her own
history, in a way she was thousands of years old.</P>
<br /><h3>The Middle Ages</h3><br />
<p>
... going only part of the way is not the same as going the wrong
way&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
A week passed without Sophie hearing from Alberto Knox. There were no
more postcards from Lebanon either, although she and Joanna
still talked about the cards they found in the major&rsquo;s cabin.
Joanna had had the fright of her life, but as nothing further seemed
to happen, the immediate terror faded and was submerged in
homework and badminton.</P>
<p>
Sophie read Alberto&rsquo;s letters over and over, looking for some
clue that would throw light on the Hilde mystery. Doing so also
gave her plenty of opportunity to digest the classical philosophy.
She no longer had difficulty in distinguishing Democritus and
Socrates, or Plato and Aristotle, from each other.</P>
<p>
On Friday, May 25, she was in the kitchen fixing dinner before
her mother got home. It was their regular Friday agreement. Today she
was making fish soup with fish balls and carrots. Plain and simple.</P>
<p>
Outside it was becoming windy. As Sophie stood stirring the
casserole she turned toward the window. The birch trees were waving
like cornstalks.</P>
<p>
Suddenly something smacked against the window-pane. Sophie turned
around again and discovered a card sticking to the window.</P>
<p>
It was a postcard. She could read it through the glass: &ldquo;Hilde
Moller Knag, c/o Sophie Amundsen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She thought as much! She opened the window and took the card. It
could hardly have blown all the way from Lebanon!</P>
<p>
This card was also dated June 15. Sophie removed the casserole from
the stove and sat down at the kitchen table. The card read:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, I don&rsquo;t know whether it will still be your birthday
when you read this card. I hope so, in a way; or at least that not
too many days have gone by. A week or two for Sophie does not have to
mean just as long for us. I shall be coming home for Midsummer Eve,
so we can sit together for hours in the glider, looking out over the
sea, Hilde. We have so much to talk about. Love from Dad, who
sometimes gets very depressed about the thousand-year-long
strife between Jews, Christians, and Muslims. I have to keep
reminding myself that all three religions stem from Abraham. So I
suppose they all pray to the same God. Down here, Cain and Abel have
not finished killing each other.</P>
<p>
P.S. Please say hello to Sophie. Poor child, she still doesn&rsquo;t
know how this whole thing hangs together. But perhaps you do?</P>
<p>
Sophie put her head down on the table, exhausted. One thing was
certain&mdash;she had no idea how this thing hung together. But Hilde
did, presumably.</P>
<p>
If Hilde&rsquo;s father asked her to say hello to Sophie, it had to
mean that Hilde knew more about Sophie than Sophie did about Hilde.
It was all so complicated that Sophie went back to fixing dinner.</P>
<p>
A postcard that smacked against the kitchen window all by itself! You
could call that airmail!</P>
<p>
As soon as she had set the casserole on the stove again, the
telephone rang.</P>
<p>
Suppose it was Dad! She wished desperately that he would come home so
she could tell him everything that had happened in these last weeks.
But it was probably only Joanna or Mom. Sophie snatched up the phone.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sophie Amundsen,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said a voice.</P>
<p>
Sophie was sure of three things: it was not her father. But it was a
man&rsquo;s voice, and a voice she knew she had heard before.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Alberto.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ohhh!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie was at a loss for words. It was the voice from the Acropolis
video that she had recognized.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;From now on there will be no more letters.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t send you a frog!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We must meet in person. It&rsquo;s beginning to be urgent, you
see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde&rsquo;s father is closing in on us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Closing in how?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;On all sides, Sophie. We have to work together now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How...?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t help much before I have told you about the
Middle Ages. We ought to cover the Renaissance and the
seventeenth century as well. Berkeley is a key figure...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he the man in the picture at the major&rsquo;s
cabin?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That very same. Maybe the actual struggle will be waged over
his philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You make it sound like a war.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I would rather call it a battle of wills. We have to attract
Hilde&rsquo;s attention and get her over on our side before her
father comes home to Lillesand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it at all.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps the philosophers can open your eyes. Meet me at St.
Mary&rsquo;s Church at eight o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning. But come
alone, my child.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So early in the morning?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The telephone clicked.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He had hung up! Sophie rushed back to the stove just before the fish
soup boiled over.</P>
<p>
St. Mary&rsquo;s Church? That was an old stone church from the Middle
Ages. It was only used for concerts and very special ceremonies. And
in the summer it was sometimes open to tourists. But surely it wasn&rsquo;t
open in the middle of the night?</P>
<p>
When her mother got home, Sophie had put the card from Lebanon with
everything else from Alberto and Hilde. After dinner she went over to
Joanna&rsquo;s place.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We have to make a very special arrangement,&rdquo; she said as
soon as her friend opened the door.</P>
<p>
She said no more until Joanna had closed her bedroom door.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather problematic,&rdquo; Sophie went on.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Spit it out!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to tell Mom that I&rsquo;m staying the
night here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Great!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only something I&rsquo;m saying, you see. I&rsquo;ve
got to go somewhere else.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad. Is it a guy?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s to do with Hilde.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna whistled softly, and Sophie looked her severely in the
eye.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming over this evening,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
at seven o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;ve got to sneak out again. You&rsquo;ve
got to cover for me until I get back.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But where are you going? What is it you have to do?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorry. My lips are sealed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sleepovers were never a problem. On the contrary, almost. Sometimes
Sophie got the impression that her mother enjoyed having the house to
herself.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be home for breakfast, I suppose?&rdquo; was her
mother&rsquo;s only remark as Sophie left the house.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not, you know where I am.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
What on earth made her say that? It was the one weak spot.</P>
<p>
Sophie&rsquo;s visit began like any other sleepover, with talk until
late into the night. The only difference was that when they finally
settled down to sleep at about two o&rsquo;clock, Sophie set the
alarm clock to a quarter to seven.</P>
<p>
Five hours later, Joanna woke briefly as Sophie switched off the
buzzer.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; she mumbled.</P>
<p>
Then Sophie was on her way. St. Mary&rsquo;s Church lay on the
outskirts of the old part of town. It was several miles walk away,
but even though she had only slept for a few hours she felt wide
awake.</P>
<p>
It was almost eight o&rsquo;clock when she stood at the entrance to
the old stone church. Sophie tried the massive door. It was
unlocked!</P>
<p>
Inside the church it was as deserted and silent as the church was
old. A bluish light filtered in through the stained-glass windows
revealing a myriad of tiny particles of dust hovering in the
air. The dust seemed to gather in thick beams this way and that
inside the church. Sophie sat on one of the benches in the center of
the nave, staring toward the altar at an old crucifix painted with
muted colors.</P>
<p>
Some minutes passed. Suddenly the organ began to play. Sophie dared
not look around. It sounded like an ancient hymn, probably from the
Middle Ages.</P>
<p>
There was silence again. Then she heard footsteps approaching
from behind her. Should she look around? She chose instead to fix her
eyes on the Cross.</P>
<p>
The footsteps passed her on their way up the aisle and she saw a
figure dressed in a brown monk&rsquo;s habit. Sophie could have
sworn it was a monk right out of the Middle Ages.</P>
<p>
She was nervous, but not scared out of her wits. In front of the
altar the monk turned in a half-circle and then climbed up into the
pulpit. He leaned over the edge, looked down at Sophie, and addressed
her in Latin:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in
principio, et nunc, et semper et in saecula saeculorum. Amen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Talk sense, silly!&rdquo; Sophie burst out.</P>
<p>
Her voice resounded all around the old stone church.</P>
<p>
Although she realized that the monk had to be Alberto Knox, she
regretted her outburst in this venerable place of worship. But she
had been nervous, and when you&rsquo;re nervous its comforting to
break all taboos.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Shhh!&rdquo; Alberto held up one hand as priests do when they
want the congregation to be seated. 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Middle Ages began at four,&rdquo; he said. 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Middle Ages began at four?&rdquo; asked Sophie, feeling stupid
but no longer nervous. 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;About four o&rsquo;clock, yes. And then it was five and six
and seven. But it was as if time stood still. And it got to be eight
and nine and ten. But it was still the Middle Ages, you see. Time to
get up to a new day, you may think. Yes, I see what you mean. But it
is still Sunday, one long endless row of Sundays. And it got to be
eleven and twelve and thirteen. This was the period we call the High
Gothic, when the great cathedrals of Europe were built. And then,
some time around fourteen hours, at two in the afternoon, a cock
crowed&mdash;and the Middle Ages began to ebb away.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So the Middle Ages lasted for ten hours then,&rdquo; said
Sophie. Alberto thrust his head forward out of the brown monk&rsquo;s
cowl and surveyed his congregation, which consisted of a
fourteen-year-old girl.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If each hour was a hundred
years, yes. We can pretend that Jesus was born at midnight. Paul
began his missionary journeys just before half past one in the
morning and died in Rome a quarter of an hour later. Around three in
the morning the Christian church was more or less banned, but by A.D.
313 it was an accepted religion in the Roman Empire. That was in the
reign of the Emperor Constantine. The holy emperor himself was first
baptized on his deathbed many years later. From the year 380
Christianity was the official religion throughout the entire Roman
Empire.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the Roman Empire fall?&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was just beginning to crumble. We are standing before one
of the greatest changes in the history of culture. Rome in the
fourth century was being threatened both by barbarians pressing in
from the north and by disintegration from within. In A.D. 330
Constantine the Great moved the capital of the Empire from Rome to
Constantinople, the city he had founded at the approach to the Black
Sea. Many people considered the new city the &ldquo;second Rome.&rdquo;
In 395 the Roman Empire was divided in two&mdash;a Western Empire
with Rome as its center, and an Eastern Empire with the new city of
Constantinople as its capital. Rome was plundered by barbarians
in 410, and in 476 the whole of the Western Empire was destroyed. The
Eastern Empire continued to exist as a state right up until 1453 when
the Turks conquered Constantinople.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And its name got changed to Istanbul?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Istanbul is its latest name. Another date
we should notice is 529. That was the year when the church closed
Plato&rsquo;s Academy in Athens. In the same year, the Benedictine
order, the first of the great monastic orders, was founded. The
year 529 thus became a symbol of the way the Christian Church put the
lid on Greek philosophy. From then on, monasteries had the monopoly
of education, reflection, and meditation. The clock was ticking
toward half past five ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie saw what Alberto meant by all these times. Midnight was 0, one
o&rsquo;clock was 100 years after Christ, six o&rsquo;clock was 600
years after Christ, and 14 hours was 1,400 years after Christ...</P>
<p>
Alberto continued: &ldquo;The Middle Ages actually means the period
between two other epochs. The expression arose during the
Renaissance. The Dark Ages, as they were also called, were seen then
as one interminable thousand-year-long night which had settled over
Europe between antiquity and the Renaissance. The word &lsquo;medieval&rsquo;
is used negatively nowadays about anything that is over-authoritative
and inflexible. But many historians now consider the Middle Ages to
have been a thousand-year period of germination and growth. The
school system, for instance, was developed in the Middle Ages.
The first convent schools were opened quite early on in the period,
and cathedral schools followed in the twelfth century. Around the
year 1200 the first universities were founded, and the subjects to be
studied were grouped into various &lsquo;faculties,&rsquo; just as
they are today.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A thousand years is a really long time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but Christianity took time to reach the masses. Moreover,
in the course of the Middle Ages the various nation-states
established themselves, with cities and citizens, folk music and
folktales. What would fairy tales and folk songs have been without
the Middle Ages? What would Europe have been, even? A Roman
province, perhaps. Yet the resonance in such names as England,
France, or Germany is the very same boundless deep we call the Middle
Ages. There are many shining fish swimming around in those depths,
although we do not always catch sight of them. Snorri lived in the
Middle Ages. So did Saint Olaf and Charlemagne, to say nothing
of Romeo and Juliet, Joan of Arc, Ivanhoe, the Pied Piper of Hamelin,
and many mighty princes and majestic kings, chivalrous knights and
fair damsels, anonymous stained-glass window makers and ingenious
organ builders. And I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned friars,
crusaders, or witches.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t mentioned the clergy, either.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Correct. Christianity didn&rsquo;t come to Norway, by the way,
until the eleventh century. It would be an exaggeration to say
that the Nordic countries converted to Christianity at one fell
swoop. Ancient heathen beliefs persisted under the surface of
Christianity, and many of these pre-Christian elements became
integrated with Christianity. In Scandinavian Christmas celebrations,
for example, Christian and Old Norse customs are wedded even to this
day. And here the old saying applies, that married folk grow to
resemble each other. Yuletide cookies, Yuletide piglets, and Yuletide
ale begin to resemble the Three Wise Men from the Orient and the
manger in Bethlehem. But without doubt, Christianity gradually became
the predominant philosophy of life. Therefore we usually speak of the
Middle Ages as being a unifying force of Christian culture.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So it wasn&rsquo;t all gloom, then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The first centuries after the year 400 really were a cultural
decline. The Roman period had been a high culture, with big
cities that had sewers, public baths, and libraries, not to mention
proud architecture. In the early centuries of the Middle Ages this
entire culture crumbled. So did its trade and economy. In the
Middle Ages people returned to payment in kind and bartering. The
economy was now characterized by feudalism, which meant that a few
powerful nobles owned the land, which the serfs had to toil on in
order to live. The population also declined steeply in the first
centuries. Rome had over a million inhabitants in antiquity. But by
600, the population of the old Roman capital had fallen to 40,000, a
mere fraction of what it had been. Thus a relatively small population
was left to wander among what remained of the majestic edifices of
the city&rsquo;s former glory. When they needed building
materials, there were plenty of ruins to supply them. This is
naturally a source of great sorrow to present-day archeologists, who
would rather have seen medieval man leave the ancient monuments
untouched.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to know better after the fact.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;From a political point of view, the Roman period was already
over by the end of the fourth century. However, the Bishop of
Rome became the supreme head of the Roman Catholic Church. He was
given the title &lsquo;Pope&rsquo;&mdash;in Latin &lsquo;papa,&rsquo;
which means what it says&mdash; and gradually became looked upon as
Christ&rsquo;s deputy on earth. Rome was thus the Christian capital
throughout most of the medieval period. But as the kings and bishops
of the new nation-states became more and more powerful, some of them
were bold enough to stand up to the might of the church.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You said the church closed Plato&rsquo;s Academy in Athens.
Does that mean that all the Greek philosophers were forgotten?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not entirely. Some of the writings of Aristotle and Plato were
known. But the old Roman Empire was gradually divided into three
different cultures. In Western Europe we had a Latinized Christian
culture with Rome as its capital. In Eastern Europe we had a Greek
Christian culture with Constantinople as its capital. This city
began to be called by its Greek name, Byzantium. We therefore speak
of the Byzantine Middle Ages as opposed to the Roman Catholic
Middle Ages. However, North Africa and the Middle East had also been
part of the Roman Empire. This area developed during the Middle
Ages into an Arabic-speaking Muslim culture. After the death of
Muhammad in 632, both the Middle East and North Africa were won over
to Islam. Shortly thereafter, Spain also became part of the world of
Islamic culture. Islam adopted Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, and
Bagdad as holy cities. From the point of view of cultural history, it
is interesting to note that the Arabs also took over the ancient
Hellenistic city of Alexandria. Thus much of the old Greek science
was inherited by the Arabs. All through the Middle Ages, the Arabs
were predominant hi sciences such as mathematics, chemistry,
astronomy, and medicine. Nowadays we still use Arabic figures. In a
number of areas Arabic culture was superior to Christian culture.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I wanted to know what happened to Greek philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you imagine a broad river that divides for a while into
three different streams before it once again becomes one great wide
river?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then you can also see how the Greco-Roman culture was divided,
but survived through the three cultures: the Roman Catholic in the
west, the Byzantine in the east, and the Arabic in the south.
Although it&rsquo;s greatly oversimplified, we could say that
Neoplatonism was handed down in the west, Plato in the east, and
Aristotle to the Arabs in the south. But there was also something of
them all in all three streams. The point is that at the end of the
Middle Ages, all three streams came together in Northern Italy. The
Arabic influence came from the Arabs in Spain, the Greek
influence from Greece and the Byzantine Empire. And now we see the
beginning of the Renaissance, the &lsquo;rebirth&rsquo; of antique
culture. In one sense, antique culture had survived the Dark Ages.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But let us not anticipate the course of events. We mast first
talk a little about medieval philosophy. I shall not speak from this
pulpit any more. I&rsquo;m coming down.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie&rsquo;s eyes were heavy from too little sleep. When she saw
the strange monk descending from the pulpit of St. Mary&rsquo;s
Church, she felt as if she were dreaming.</P>
<p>
Alberto walked toward the altar rail. He looked up at the altar with
its ancient crucifix, then he walked slowly toward Sophie. He sat
down beside her on the bench of the pew.</P>
<p>
It was a strange feeling, being so close to him. Under his cowl
Sophie saw a pair of deep brown eyes. They belonged to a middle-aged
man with dark hair and a little pointed beard. Who are you, she
wondered. Why have you turned my life upside down?</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We shall become better acquainted by and by,&rdquo; he said,
as if he had read her thoughts.</P>
<p>
As they sat there together, with the light that filtered into the
church through the stained-glass windows becoming sharper and
sharper, Alberto Knox began to talk about medieval philosophy.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The medieval philosophers took it almost for granted that
Christianity was true,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;The question was
whether we must simply believe the Christian revelation or
whether we can approach the Christian truths with the help of reason.
What was the relationship between the Greek philosophers and what the
Bible said? Was there a contradiction between the Bible and reason,
or were belief and knowledge compatible? Almost all medieval
philosophy centered on this one question.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie nodded impatiently. She had been through this in her religion
class.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We shall see how the two most prominent medieval philosophers
dealt with this question, and we might as well begin with St.
Augustine, who lived from 354 to 430. In this one person&rsquo;s life
we can observe the actual transition from late antiquity to the Early
Middle Ages. Augustine was born in the little town of Tagaste in
North Africa. At the age of sixteen he went to Carthage to study.
Later he traveled to Rome and Milan, and lived the last years of his
life in the town of Hippo, a few miles west of Carthage. However, he
was not a Christian all his life. Augustine examined several
different religions and philosophies before he became a
Christian.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Could you give some examples?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For a time he was a Manichaean. The Manichaeans were a
religious sect that was extremely characteristic of late antiquity.
Their doctrine was half religion and half philosophy, asserting that
the world consisted of a dualism of good and evil, light and
darkness, spirit and matter. With his spirit, mankind could rise
above the world of matter and thus prepare for the salvation of his
soul. But this sharp division between good and evil gave the young
Augustine no peace of mind. He was completely preoccupied with
what we like to call the &lsquo;problem of evil.&rsquo; By this
we mean the question of where evil comes from. For a time he was
influenced by Stoic philosophy, and according to the Stoics,
there was no sharp division between good and evil. However, his
principal leanings were toward the other significant philosophy of
late antiquity, Neoplatonism. Here he came across the idea that all
existence is divine in nature.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he became a Neoplatonic bishop?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you could say that. He became a Christian first, but the
Christianity of St. Augustine is largely influenced by Platonic
ideas. And therefore, Sophie, therefore you have to understand that
there is no dramatic break with Greek philosophy the minute we enter
the Christian Middle Ages. Much of Greek philosophy was carried over
to the new age through Fathers of the Church like St. Augustine.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean that St. Augustine was half Christian and half
Neoplatonist?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He himself believed he was a hundred-percent Christian
although he saw no real contradiction between Christianity and the
philosophy of Plato. For him, the similarity between Plato and the
Christian doctrine was so apparent that he thought Plato must have
had knowledge of the Old Testament. This, of course, is highly
improbable. Let us rather say that it was St. Augustine who
&lsquo;christianized&rsquo; Plato.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he didn&rsquo;t turn his back on everything that had to do
with philosophy when he started believing in Christianity?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, but he pointed out that there are limits to how far reason
can get you in religious questions. Christianity is a divine mystery
that we can only perceive through faith. But if we believe in
Christianity, God will &lsquo;illuminate&rsquo; the soul so that we
experience a sort of supernatural knowledge of God. St.
Augustine had felt within himself that there was a limit to how far
philosophy could go. Not before he became a Christian did he find
peace in his own soul. &lsquo;Our heart is not quiet until it rests
in Thee,&rsquo; he writes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand how Plato&rsquo;s ideas could
go together with Christianity,&rdquo; Sophie objected. &ldquo;What
about the eternal ideas?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, St. Augustine certainly maintains that God created the
world out of the void, and that was a Biblical idea. The Greeks
preferred the idea that the world had always existed. But St.
Augustine believed that before God created the world, the &lsquo;ideas&rsquo;
were in the Divine mind. So he located the Platonic ideas in God and
in that way preserved the Platonic view of eternal ideas.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was smart.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it indicates how not only St. Augustine but many of the
other Church Fathers bent over backward to bring Greek and Jewish
thought together. In a sense they were of two cultures. Augustine
also inclined to Neoplatonism in his view of evil. He believed, like
Plotinus, that evil is the &lsquo;absence of God.&rsquo; Evil has no
independent existence, it is something that is not, for God&rsquo;s
creation is in fact only good. Evil comes from mankind&rsquo;s
disobedience, Augustine believed. Or, in his own words, &lsquo;The
good will is God&rsquo;s work; the evil will is the falling away from
God&rsquo;s work.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did he also believe that man has a divine soul?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes and no. St. Augustine maintained that there is an
insurmountable barrier between God and the world. In this he stands
firmly on Biblical ground, rejecting the doctrine of Plotinus that
everything is one. But he nevertheless emphasizes that man is a
spiritual being. He has a material body&mdash;which belongs to the
physical world which &lsquo;moth and rust doth corrupt&rsquo;&mdash;but
he also has a soul which can know God.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What happens to the soul when we die?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;According to St. Augustine, the entire human race was lost
after the Fall of Man. But God nevertheless decided that certain
people should be saved from perdition.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In that case, God could just as well have decided that
everybody should be saved.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As far as that goes, St. Augustine denied that man has any
right to criticize God, referring to Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the
Romans: &lsquo;O Man, who art thou that replies! against God? Shall
the thing formed say to him that formed it; why hast thou made me
thus? or Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to
make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So God sits up in his Heaven playing with people? And as soon
as he is dissatisfied with one of his creations, he just throws
it away.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;St. Augustine&rsquo;s point was that no man deserves God&rsquo;s
redemption. And yet God has chosen some to be saved from damnation,
so for him there was nothing secret about who will be saved and who
damned. It is preordained. We are entirely at his mercy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So in a way, he returned to the old belief in fate.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps. But St. Augustine did not renounce man&rsquo;s
responsibility for his own life. He taught that we must live in
awareness of being among the chosen. He did not deny that we have
free will. But God has &lsquo;foreseen&rsquo; how we will live.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather unfair?&rdquo; asked Sophie. &ldquo;Socrates
said that we all had the same chances because we all had the same
common sense. But St. Augustine divides people into two groups. One
group gets saved and the other gets damned.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are right in that St. Augustine&rsquo;s theology is
considerably removed from the humanism of Athens. But St.
Augustine wasn&rsquo;t dividing humanity into two groups. He was
merely expounding the Biblical doctrine of salvation and
damnation. He explained this in a learned work called the City of
God.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me about that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;City of God,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Kingdom of
God,&rsquo; comes from the Bible and the teachings of Jesus. St.
Augustine believed that all human history is a struggle between the
&lsquo;Kingdom of God&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Kingdom of the World.&rsquo;
The two &lsquo;kingdoms&rsquo; are not political kingdoms distinct
from each other. They struggle for mastery inside every single
person. Nevertheless, the Kingdom of God is more or less clearly
present in the Church, and the Kingdom of the World is present in the
State&mdash;for example, in the Roman Empire, which was in decline at
the time of St. Augustine. This conception became increasingly
clear as Church and State fought for supremacy throughout the
Middle Ages. There is no salvation outside the Church,&rsquo; it was
now said. St. Augustine&rsquo;s &lsquo;City of God&rsquo; eventually
became identical with the established Church. Not until the
Reformation in the sixteenth century was there any protest
against the idea that people could only obtain salvation through the
Church.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was about time!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We can also observe that St. Augustine was the first
philosopher we have come across to draw history into his philosophy.
The struggle between good and evil was by no means new. What was new
was that for Augustine the struggle was played out in history. There
is not much of Plato in this aspect of St. Augustine&rsquo;s work. He
was more influenced by the linear view of history as we meet it in
the Old Testament: the idea that God needs all of history in order to
realize his Kingdom of God. History is necessary for the
enlightenment of man and the destruction of evil. Or, as St.
Augustine put it, &lsquo;Divine foresight directs the history of
mankind from Adam to the end of time as if it were the story of one
man who gradually develops from childhood to old age.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie looked at her watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go soon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But first I must tell you about the other great medieval
philosopher. Shall we sit outside?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto stood up. He placed the palms of his hands together and began
to stride down the aisle. He looked as if he was praying or
meditating deeply on some spiritual truth. Sophie followed him;
she felt she had no choice.</P>
<p>
The sun had not yet broken through the morning clouds. Alberto seated
himself on a bench outside the church. Sophie wondered what people
would think if anyone came by. Sitting on a church bench at ten in
the morning was odd in itself, and sitting with a medieval monk
wouldn&rsquo;t make things look any better.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;About four
hundred years have elapsed since St. Augustine, and now school
starts. From now until ten o&rsquo;clock, convent schools will have
the monopoly on education. Between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock the
first cathedral schools will be founded, followed at noon by the
first universities. The great Gothic cathedrals will be built at the
same time. This church, too, dates from the 1200s&mdash;or what we
call the High Gothic period. In this town they couldn&rsquo;t afford
a large cathedral.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t need one,&rdquo; Sophie said. &ldquo;I hate
empty churches.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but the great cathedrals were not built only for large
congregations. They were built to the glory of God and were in
themselves a kind of religious celebration. However, something else
happened during this period which has special significance for
philosophers like us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto continued: &ldquo;The influence of the Arabs of Spain began
to make itself felt. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Arabs had kept
the Aristotelian tradition alive, and from the end of the twelfth
century, Arab scholars began to arrive in Northern Italy at the
invitation of the nobles. Many of Aristotle&rsquo;s writings thus
became known and were translated from Greek and Arabic into Latin.
This created a new interest in the natural sciences and infused new
life into the question of the Christian revelation&rsquo;s
relationship to Greek philosophy. Aristotle could obviously no longer
be ignored in matters of science, but when should one attend to
Aristotle the philosopher, and when should one stick to the
Bible? Do you see?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie nodded, and the monk went on:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The greatest and most significant philosopher of this period
was St. Thomas Aquinas, who lived from 1225 to 1274. He came from the
little town of Aquino, between Rome and Naples, but he also
worked as a teacher at the University of Paris. I call him a
philosopher but he was just as much a theologian. There was no great
difference between philosophy and theology at that time. Briefly, we
can say that Aquinas christianized Aristotle in the same way that St.
Augustine christianized Plato in early medieval times.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it rather an odd thing to do, christianizing
philosophers who had lived several hundred years before Christ?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You could say so. But by &lsquo;christianizing&rsquo; these
two great Greek philosophers, we only mean that they were interpreted
and explained in such a way that they were no longer considered a
threat to Christian dogma. Aquinas was among those who tried to
make Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy compatible with Christianity.
We say that he created the great synthesis between faith and
knowledge. He did this by entering the philosophy of Aristotle and
taking him at his word.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I had hardly any sleep last night. I&rsquo;m
afraid you&rsquo;ll have to explain it more clearly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Aquinas believed that there need be no conflict between
what philosophy or reason teaches us and what the Christian
Revelation or faith teaches us. Christendom and philosophy often say
the same thing. So we can frequently reason ourselves to the same
truths that we can read in the Bible.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How come? Can reason tell us that God created the world in six
days or that Jesus was the Son of God?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, those so-called verities of faith are only accessible
through belief and the Christian Revelation. But Aquinas believed in
the existence of a number of &lsquo;natural theological truths.&rsquo;
By that he meant truths that could be reached both through Christian
faith and through our innate or natural reason. For example, the
truth that there is a God. Aquinas believed that there are two paths
to God. One path goes through faith and the Christian Revelation, and
the other goes through reason and the senses. Of these two, the path
of faith and revelation is certainly the surest, because it is
easy to lose one&rsquo;s way by trusting to reason alone. But
Aquinas&rsquo;s point was that there need not be any conflict between
a philosopher like Aristotle and the Christian doctrine.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So we can take our choice between believing Aristotle and
believing the Bible?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not at all. Aristotle goes only part of the way because
he didn&rsquo;t know of the Christian revelation. But going only part
of the way is not the same as going the wrong way. For example, it is
not wrong to say that Athens is in Europe. But neither is it
particularly precise. If a book only tells you that Athens is a city
in Europe, it would be wise to look it up in a geography book as
well. There you would find the whole truth that Athens is the capital
of Greece, a small country in southeastern Europe. If you are lucky
you might be told a little about the Acropolis as well. Not to
mention Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But the first bit of information about Athens was true.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly! Aquinas wanted to prove that there is only one truth.
So when Aristotle shows us something our reason tells us is true, it
is not in conflict with Christian teaching. We can arrive
successfully at one aspect of the truth with the aid of reason and
the evidence of our senses. For example, the kind of truths Aristotle
refers to when he describes the plant and the animal kingdom. Another
aspect of the truth is revealed to us by God through the Bible. But
the two aspects of the truth overlap at significant points.
There are many questions about which the Bible and reason tell us
exactly the same thing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like there being a God?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy also presumed the
existence of a God&mdash;or a formal cause&mdash;which sets all
natural processes going. But he gives no further description of
God. For this we must rely solely on the Bible and the teachings of
Jesus.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it so absolutely certain that there is a God?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It can be disputed, obviously. But even in our day most people
will agree that human reason is certainly not capable of disproving
the existence of God. Aquinas went further. He believed that he could
prove God&rsquo;s existence on the basis of Aristotle&rsquo;s
philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not bad!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;With our reason we can recognize that everything around us
must have a &lsquo;formal cause,&rsquo; he believed. God has revealed
himself to mankind both through the Bible and through reason. There
is thus both a &lsquo;theology of faith&rsquo; and a &lsquo;natural
theology.&rsquo; The same is true of the moral aspect. The Bible
teaches us how God wants us to live. But God has also given us a
conscience which enables us to distinguish between right and wrong on
a &lsquo;natural&rsquo; basis. There are thus also &lsquo;two paths&rsquo;
to a moral life. We know that it is wrong to harm people even if we
haven&rsquo;t read in the Bible that we must &lsquo;do unto others
as you would have them do unto you.&rsquo; Here, too, the surest
guide is to follow the Bible&rsquo;s commandment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; said Sophie now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
almost like how we know there&rsquo;s a thunderstorm, by seeing the
lightning and by hearing the thunder.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! We can hear the thunder even if we are
blind, and we can see the lightning even if we are deaf. It&rsquo;s
best if we can both see and hear, of course. But there is no
contradiction between what we see and what we hear. On the
contrary&mdash;the two impressions reinforce each other.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me add another picture. If you read a novel&mdash; John
Steinbeck&rsquo;s Of Mice and Men, for example ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read that, actually.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel you know something about the author
just by reading his book?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I realize there is a person who wrote it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that all you know about him?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He seems to care about outsiders.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When you read this book&mdash;which is Steinbeck&rsquo;s
creation&mdash;you get to know something about Steinbeck&rsquo;s
nature as well. But you cannot expect to get any personal
information about the author. Could you tell from reading Of
Mice and Men how old the author was when he wrote it, where he lived,
or how many children he had?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you can find this information in a biography of John
Steinbeck. Only in a biography&mdash;or an autobiography&mdash;can
you get better acquainted with Steinbeck, the person.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more or less how it is with God&rsquo;s Creation
and the Bible. We can recognize that there is a God just by walking
around in the natural world. We can easily see that He loves flowers
and animals, otherwise He would not have made them. But information
about God, the person, is only found in the Bible&mdash;or in God&rsquo;s
&lsquo;autobiography,&rsquo; if you like.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good at finding examples.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Mmmm...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
For the first time Alberto just sat there thinking&mdash; without
answering.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does all this have anything to do with Hilde?&rdquo; Sophie
could not help asking.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know whether there is a &lsquo;Hilde&rsquo; at
all.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But we know someone is planting evidence of her all over the
place. Postcards, a silk scarf, a green wallet, a stocking ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto nodded. &ldquo;And it seems as if it is Hilde&rsquo;s father
who is deciding how many clues he will plant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For
now, all we know is that someone is sending us a lot of postcards. I
wish he would write something about himself too. But we shall return
to that later.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a quarter to eleven. I&rsquo;ll have to get home
before the end of the Middle Ages.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I shall just conclude with a few words about how Aquinas
adopted Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy in all the areas where it did
not collide with the Church&rsquo;s theology. These included his
logic, his theory of knowledge, and not least his natural philosophy.
Do you recall, for example, how Aristotle described the
progressive scale of life from plants and animals to humans?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie nodded.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Aristotle believed that this scale indicated a God that
constituted a sort of maximum of existence. This scheme of things was
not difficult to align with Christian theology. According to
Aquinas, there was a progressive degree of existence from plants and
animals to man, from man to angels, and from angels to God. Man, like
animals, has a body and sensory organs, but man also has intelligence
which enables him to reason things out.</P>
<p>
Angels have no such body with sensory organs, which is why they have
spontaneous and immediate intelligence. They have no need to
&lsquo;ponder,&rsquo; like humans; they have no need to reason out
conclusions. They know everything that man can know without having to
learn it step by step like us. And since angels have no body, they
can never die. They are not everlasting like God, because they were
once created by God. But they have no body that they must one day
depart from, and so they will never die.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That sounds lovely!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But up above the angels, God rules, Sophie. He can see and
know everything in one single coherent vision.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he can see us now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, perhaps he can. But not &lsquo;now.&rsquo; For God, time
does not exist as it does for us. Our &lsquo;now&rsquo; is not God&rsquo;s
&lsquo;now.&rsquo; Because many weeks pass for us, they do not
necessarily pass for God.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s creepy!&rdquo; Sophie exclaimed. She put her hand
over her mouth. Alberto looked down at her, and Sophie continued: &ldquo;I
got another card from Hilde&rsquo;s father yesterday. He wrote
something like&mdash;even if it takes a week or two for Sophie, that
doesn&rsquo;t have to mean it will be that long for us. That&rsquo;s
almost the same as what you said about God!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie could see a sudden frown flash across Alberto&rsquo;s
face beneath the brown cowl.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He ought to be ashamed of himself!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie didn&rsquo;t quite understand what Alberto meant. He went on:
&ldquo;Unfortunately, Aquinas also adopted Aristotle&rsquo;s
view of women. You may perhaps recall that Aristotle thought a woman
was more or less an incomplete man. He also thought that
children only inherit the father&rsquo;s characteristics, since a
woman was passive and receptive while the man was active and
creative. According to Aquinas, these views harmonized with the
message of the Bible&mdash;which, for example, tells us that woman
was made out of Adam&rsquo;s rib.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting to note that the eggs of mammals were
not discovered until 1827. It was therefore perhaps not so surprising
that people thought it was the man who was the creative and
lifegiving force in reproduction. We can moreover note that,
according to Aquinas, it is only as nature-being that woman is
inferior to man. Woman&rsquo;s soul is equal to man&rsquo;s soul. In
Heaven there is complete equality of the sexes because all physical
gender differences cease to exist.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cold comfort. Weren&rsquo;t there any women
philosophers in the Middle Ages?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The life of the church in the Middle Ages was heavily
dominated by men. But that did not mean that there were no women
thinkers. One of them was Hildegard of Bingen...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie&rsquo;s eyes widened:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does she have anything to do with Hilde?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a question! Hildegard lived as a nun in the Rhine Valley
from 1098 to 1179. In spite of being a woman, she worked as preacher,
author, physician, botanist, and naturalist. She is an example
of the fact that women were often more practical, more scientific
even, in the Middle Ages.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But what about Hilde?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was an ancient Christian and Jewish belief that God was not
only a man. He also had a female side, or &lsquo;mother nature.&rsquo;
Women, too, are created in God&rsquo;s likeness. In Greek, this
female side of God is called Sophia. &lsquo;Sophia&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sophie&rsquo;
means wisdom.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie shook her head resignedly. Why had nobody ever told her that?
And why had she never asked?</P>
<p>
Alberto continued: &ldquo;Sophia, or God&rsquo;s mother nature, had a
certain significance both for Jews and in the Greek Orthodox Church
throughout the Middle Ages. In the west she was forgotten. But along
comes Hildegard. Sophia appeared to her in a vision, dressed in
a golden tunic adorned with costly jewels ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie stood up. Sophia had revealed herself to Hildegard in a
vision ...</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe I will appear to Hilde.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She sat down again. For the third time Alberto laid his hand on her
shoulder.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is something we must look into. But now it is past eleven
o&rsquo;clock. You must go home, and we are approaching a new era. I
shall summon you to a meeting on the Renaissance. Hermes will come
get you in the garden.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
With that the strange monk rose and began to walk toward the church.
Sophie stayed where she was, thinking about Hildegard and
Sophia, Hilde and Sophie. Suddenly she jumped up and ran after
the monk-robed philosopher, calling:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was there also an Alberto in the Middle Ages?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto slowed his pace somewhat, turned his head slightly and said,
&ldquo;Aquinas had a famous philosophy teacher called Albert the
Great...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
With that he bowed his head and disappeared through the door of St.
Mary&rsquo;s Church.</P>
<p>
Sophie was not satisfied with his answer. She followed him into
the church. But now it was completely empty. Did he go through the
floor?</P>
<p>
Just as she was leaving the church she noticed a picture of the
Madonna. She went up to it and studied it closely. Suddenly she
discovered a little drop of water under one of the Madonna&rsquo;s
eyes. Was it a tear?</P>
<p>
Sophie rushed out of the church and hurried back to Joanna&rsquo;s.</P>
<br /><h3>The Renaissance</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;O divine lineage in mortal guise&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
It was just twelve when Sophie reached Joanna&rsquo;s front gate, out
of breath with running. Joanna was standing in the front yard outside
her family&rsquo;s yellow house.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been gone for five hours!&rdquo; Joanna said
sharply.</P>
<p>
Sophie shook her head.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve been gone for more than a thousand years.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Where on earth have you been? You&rsquo;re crazy. Your mom
called half an hour ago.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What did you tell her?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I said you were at the drugstore. She said would you call her
when you got back. But you should have seen my mom and dad when they
came in with hot chocolate and rolls at ten this morning ... and your
bed was empty.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What did you say to them?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was really embarrassing. I told them you went home because
we got mad at each other.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So we&rsquo;d better hurry up and be friends again. And we
have to make sure your parents don&rsquo;t talk to my mom for a few
days. Do you think we can do that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna shrugged. Just then her father came around the corner with a
wheelbarrow. He had a pair of coveralls on and was busy clearing up
last year&rsquo;s leaves and twigs.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Aha&mdash;so you&rsquo;re friends again, I see. Well, there&rsquo;s
not so much as a single leaf left on the basement steps now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; said Sophie. &ldquo;So perhaps we can have our
hot chocolate there instead of in bed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna&rsquo;s dad gave a forced laugh, but Joanna gasped. Verbal
exchanges had always been more robust in Sophie&rsquo;s family
than at the more well-to-do home of Mr. Ingebrigtsen, the financial
adviser, and his wife.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Joanna, but I felt I ought to take part in
this cover-up operation as well.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to tell me about it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure, if you walk home with me. Because it&rsquo;s not for the
ears of financial advisers or overgrown Barbie dolls.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rotten thing to say! I suppose you think a
rocky marriage that drives one of the partners away to sea is
better?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Probably not. But I hardly slept last night. And another
thing, I&rsquo;ve begun to wonder whether Hilde can see everything we
do.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They began to walk toward Clover Close.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You mean she might have second sight?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe. Maybe not.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Joanna was clearly not enthusiastic about all this secrecy.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t explain why her father sent a lot of
crazy postcards to an empty cabin in the woods.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I admit that is a weak spot.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you want to tell me where you have been?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
So she did. Sophie told her everything, about the mysterious
philosophy course as well. She made Joanna swear to keep everything
secret.</P>
<p>
They walked for a long time without speaking. As they approached
Clover Close, Joanna said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She stopped at Sophie&rsquo;s gate and turned to go home again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nobody asked you to like it. But philosophy is not a harmless
party game. It&rsquo;s about who we are and where we come from. Do
you think we learn enough about that at school?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Nobody can answer questions like that anyway.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but we don&rsquo;t even learn to ask them!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Lunch was on the table when Sophie walked into the kitchen. Nothing
was said about her not having called from Joanna&rsquo;s.</P>
<p>
After lunch Sophie announced that she was going to take a nap. She
admitted she had hardly slept at Joanna&rsquo;s house, which was not
at all unusual at a sleepover.</P>
<p>
Before getting into bed she stood in front of the big brass mirror
which now hung on her wall. At first she only saw her own white and
exhausted face. But then&mdash; behind her own face, the faintest
suggestion of another face seemed to appear. Sophie took one or two
deep breaths. It was no good starting to imagine things.</P>
<p>
She studied the sharp contours of her own pale face framed by that
impossible hair which defied any style but nature&rsquo;s own. But
beyond that face was the apparition of another girl. Suddenly
the other girl began to wink frantically with both eyes, as if to
signal that she was really in there on the other side. The apparition
lasted only a few seconds. Then she was gone.</P>
<p>
Sophie sat down on the edge of the bed. She had absolutely no doubt
that it was Hilde she had seen in the mirror. She had caught a
glimpse of her picture on a school I.D. in the major&rsquo;s cabin.
It must have been the same girl she had seen in the mirror.</P>
<p>
Wasn&rsquo;t it odd, how she always experienced mysterious
things like this when she was dead tired. It meant that afterward she
always had to ask herself whether it really had happened.</P>
<p>
Sophie laid her clothes on the chair and crawled into bed. She fell
asleep at once and had a strangely vivid dream.</P>
<p>
She dreamed she was standing in a large garden that sloped down to a
red boathouse. On the dock behind it sat a young fair-haired girl
gazing out over the water. Sophie walked down and sat beside her. But
the girl seemed not to notice her. Sophie introduced herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
Sophie,&rdquo; she said. But the other girl could apparently
neither see nor hear her. Suddenly Sophie heard a voice calling,
&ldquo;Hilde!&rdquo; At once the girl jumped up from where she was
sitting and ran as fast as she could up to the house. She couldn&rsquo;t
have been deaf or blind after all. A middle-aged man came striding
from the house toward her. He was wearing a khaki uniform and a blue
beret. The girl threw her arms around his neck and he swung her
around a few times. Sophie noticed a little gold crucifix on a chain
lying on the dock where the girl had been sitting. She picked it up
and held it in her hand. Then she woke up.</P>
<p>
Sophie looked at the clock. She had been asleep for two hours. She
sat up in bed, thinking about the strange dream. It was so real that
she felt as if she had actually lived the experience. She was equally
sure that the house and the dock really existed somewhere. Surely it
resembled the picture she had seen hanging in the major&rsquo;s
cabin? Anyway, there was no doubt at all that the girl in her dream
was Hilde Moller Knag and that the man was her father, home from
Lebanon. In her dream he had looked a lot like Alberto Knox ...</P>
<p>
As Sophie stood up and began to tidy her bed, she found a gold
crucifix on a chain under her pillow. On the back of the crucifix
there were three letters engraved: HMK.</P>
<p>
This was not the first time Sophie had dreamed she found a treasure.
But this was definitely the first time she had brought it back from
the dream.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; she said aloud.</P>
<p>
She was so mad that she opened the closet door and hurled the
delicate crucifix up onto the top shelf with the silk scarf, the
white stocking, and the postcards from Lebanon.</P>
<p>
The next morning Sophie woke up to a big breakfast of hot rolls,
orange juice, eggs, and vegetable salad. It was not often that her
mother was up before Sophie on a Sunday morning. When she was, she
liked to fix a solid meal for Sophie.</P>
<p>
While they were eating, Mom said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a strange dog
in the garden. It&rsquo;s been sniffing round the old hedge all
morning. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it&rsquo;s doing here, can you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Sophie burst out, and at once regretted it.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Has it been here before?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie had already left the table and gone into the living room to
look out of the window facing the large garden. It was just as she
thought.</P>
<p>
Hermes was lying in front of the secret entrance to her den.</P>
<p>
What should she say? She had no time to think of anything before her
mother came and stood beside her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you say it had been here before?&rdquo; she asked.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I expect it buried a bone there and now it&rsquo;s come to
fetch its treasure. Dogs have memories too ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right, Sophie. You&rsquo;re the animal
psychologist in the family.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie thought feverishly.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it home,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You know where it lives, then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie shrugged her shoulders.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably got an address on its collar.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
A couple of minutes later Sophie was on her way down the garden. When
Hermes caught sight of her he came lolloping toward her, wagging his
tail and jumping up to her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Good boy, Hermes!&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
She knew her mother was watching from the window. She prayed he would
not go through the hedge. But the dog dashed toward the gravel path
in front of the house, streaked across the front yard, and jumped up
to the gate.</P>
<p>
When they had shut the gate behind them, Hermes continued to run a
few yards in front of Sophie. It was a long way. Sophie and Hermes
were not the only ones out for a Sunday walk. Whole families were
setting off for the day. Sophie felt a pang of envy.</P>
<p>
From time to time Hermes would run off and sniff at another dog or at
something interesting by a garden hedge, but as soon as Sophie called
&ldquo;Here, boy!&rdquo; he would come back to her at once.</P>
<p>
They crossed an old pasture, a large playing field, and a playground,
and emerged into an area with more traffic. They continued
toward the town center along a broad street with cobbled stones and
streetcars. Hermes led the way across the town square and up Church
Street. They came out into the Old Town, with its massive staid town
houses from the turn of the century. It was almost half past one.</P>
<p>
Now they were on the other side of town. Sophie had not been there
very often. Once when she was little, she remembered, she had been
taken to visit an old aunt in one of these streets.</P>
<p>
Eventually they reached a little square between several old
houses. It was called New Square, although it all looked very old.
But then the whole town was old; it had been founded way back in the
Middle Ages.</P>
<p>
Hermes walked toward No. 14, where he stood still and waited for
Sophie to open the door. Her heart began to beat faster.</P>
<p>
Inside the front door there were a number of green mailboxes attached
to a panel. Sophie noticed a postcard hanging from one of the
mailboxes in the top row. It had a stamped message from the mailman
across it to the effect that the addressee was unknown.</P>
<p>
The addressee was Hilde Moller Knag, 14 New Square. It was postmarked
June 15. That was not for two weeks, but the mailman had obviously
not noticed that.</P>
<p>
Sophie took the card down and read it:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, Now Sophie is coming to the philosopher&rsquo;s
house. She will soon be fifteen, but you were fifteen yesterday. Or
is it today, Hilde? If it is today, it must be late, then. But our
watches do not always agree. One generation ages while another
generation is brought forth. In the meantime history takes its
course. Have you ever thought that the history of Europe is like a
human life? Antiquity is like the childhood of Europe. Then come
the interminable Middle Ages&mdash;Europe&rsquo;s schoolday. But at
last comes the Renaissance; the long school-day is over. Europe comes
of age in a burst of exuberance and a thirst for life. We could
say that the Renaissance is Europe&rsquo;s fifteenth birthday! It is
mid-June, my child, and it is wonderful to be alive!</P>
<p>
P.S. Sorry to hear you lost your gold crucifix. You must learn to
take better care of your things. Love, Dad&mdash;who is just around
the corner.</P>
<p>
Hermes was already on his way up the stairs. Sophie took the postcard
with her and followed. She had to run to keep up with him; he was
wagging his tail delightedly. They passed the second, third, and
fourth stories. From then on there was only an attic staircase. Were
they going up to the roof? Hermes clambered on up the stairs and
stopped outside a narrow door, which he scratched at with his paw.</P>
<p>
Sophie heard footsteps approaching from inside. The door opened, and
there stood Alberto Knox. He had changed his clothes and was now
wearing another costume. It consisted of white hose, red
knee-breeches, and a yellow jacket with padded shoulders. He reminded
Sophie of a joker in a deck of cards. If she was not much
mistaken, this was a typical Renaissance costume.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a clown!&rdquo; Sophie exclaimed, giving him a little
push so that she could go inside the apartment.</P>
<p>
Once again she had taken out her fear and shyness on the unfortunate
philosophy teacher. Sophie&rsquo;s thoughts were in a turmoil because
of the postcard she had found down in the hallway.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Be calm, my child,&rdquo; said Alberto, closing the door
behind her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the mail,&rdquo; she said, handing him the
postcard as if she held him responsible for it.</P>
<p>
Alberto read it and shook his head.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He gets more and more audacious. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if he isn&rsquo;t using us as a kind of birthday diversion for
his daughter.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
With that he tore the postcard into small pieces and threw them into
the wastepaper basket.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It said that Hilde has lost her crucifix,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So I read.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And I found it, the same one, under my pillow at home. Can you
understand how it got there?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto looked gravely into her eyes.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It may seem alluring. But it&rsquo;s just a cheap trick that
costs him no effort whatsoever. Let us rather concentrate on the big
white rabbit that is pulled out of the universe&rsquo;s top
hat.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They went into the living room. It was one of the most extraordinary
rooms Sophie had ever seen.</P>
<p>
Alberto lived in a spacious attic apartment with sloping walls.
A sharp light directly from the sky flooded the room from a skylight
set into one of the walls. There was also another window facing the
town. Through this window Sophie could look over all the roofs in the
Old Town.</P>
<p>
But what amazed Sophie most was all the stuff the room was filled
with&mdash;furniture and objects from various historical
periods. There was a sofa from the thirties, an old desk from the
beginning of the century, and a chair that had to be hundreds of
years old. But it wasn&rsquo;t just the furniture. Old objects,
either useful or decorative, were jumbled together on shelves
and cupboards. There were old clocks and vases, mortars and retorts,
knives and dolls, quill pens and bookends, octants and sextants,
compasses and barometers. One entire wall was covered with books, but
not the sort of books found in most bookstores. The book collection
itself was a cross section of the production of many hundreds of
years. On the other walls hung drawings and paintings, some from
recent decades, but most of them also very old. There were a lot of
old charts and maps on the walls too, and as far as Norway was
concerned, they were not very accurate.</P>
<p>
Sophie stood for several minutes without speaking and took everything
in.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a lot of old junk you&rsquo;ve collected,&rdquo; she
said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now then! Just think of how many centuries of history I
have preserved in this room. I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly call it junk.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you manage an antique shop or something?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto looked almost pained.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t all let ourselves be washed away by the tide of
history, Sophie. Some of us must tarry in order to gather up what has
been left along the river banks.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What an odd thing to say.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Yes, but none the less true, child. We do not live in our own
time alone; we carry our history within us. Don&rsquo;t forget that
everything you see in this room was once brand new. That old
sixteenth-century wooden doll might have been made for a
five-year-old girl&rsquo;s birthday. By her old grandfather, maybe...
then she became a teenager, then an adult, and then she married.
Maybe she had a daughter of her own and gave the doll to her. She
grew old, and one day she died. Although she had lived for a very
long time, one day she was dead and gone. And she will never return.
Actually she was only here for a short visit. But her doll&mdash;well,
there it is on the shelf.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Everything sounds so sad and solemn when you talk like that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Life is both sad and solemn. We are let into a wonderful
world, we meet one another here, greet each other&mdash;and wander
together for a brief moment. Then we lose each other and disappear as
suddenly and unreasonably as we arrived.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;May I ask you something?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not playing hide-and-seek any more.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why did you move into the major&rsquo;s cabin?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So that we would not be so far from each other, when we were
only talking by letter. I knew the old cabin would be empty.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So you just moved in?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I moved in.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then maybe you can also explain how Hilde&rsquo;s father knew
you were there.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If I am right, he knows practically everything.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I still can&rsquo;t understand at all how you get a
mailman to deliver mail in the middle of the woods!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto smiled archly.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Even things like that are a pure bagatelle for Hilde&rsquo;s
father. Cheap hocus-pocus, simple sleight of hand. We are living
under what is possibly the world&rsquo;s closest surveillance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie could feel herself getting angry.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If I ever meet him, I&rsquo;ll scratch his eyes out!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto walked over and sat down on the sofa. Sophie followed and
sank into a deep armchair.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Only philosophy can bring us closer to Hilde&rsquo;s father,&rdquo;
Alberto said at last. &ldquo;Today I shall tell you about the
Renaissance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Shoot.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not very long after St. Thomas Aquinas, cracks began to
appear in the unifying culture of Christianity. Philosophy and
science broke away more and more from the theology of the Church,
thus enabling religious life to attain a freer relationship to
reasoning. More people now emphasized that we cannot reach God
through rationalism because God is in all ways unknowable. The
important thing for a man was not to understand the divine mystery
but to submit to God&rsquo;s will.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As religion and science could now relate more freely to each
other, the way was open both to new scientific methods and a new
religious fervor. Thus the basis was created for two powerful
upheavals in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, namely, the
Renaissance and the Reformation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can we take them one at a time?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;By the Renaissance we mean the rich cultural development
that began in the late fourteenth century. It started in Northern
Italy and spread rapidly northward during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me that the word &lsquo;renaissance&rsquo;
meant rebirth?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I did indeed, and that which was to be reborn was the art and
culture of antiquity. We also speak of Renaissance humanism,
since now, after the long Dark Ages in which every aspect of life was
seen through divine light, everything once again revolved around man.
&lsquo;Go to the source&rsquo; was the motto, and that meant the
humanism of antiquity first and foremost.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It almost became a popular pastime to dig up ancient
sculptures and scrolls, just as it became fashionable to learn Greek.
The study of Greek humanism also had a pedagogical aim. Reading
humanistic subjects provided a &lsquo;classical education&rsquo; and
developed what may be called human qualities. &lsquo;Horses are
born,&rsquo; it was said, &lsquo;but human beings are not born&mdash;they
are formed.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Do we have to be educated to be human beings?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that was the thought. But before we take a closer look at
the ideas of Renaissance humanism, we must say a little about the
political and cultural background of the Renaissance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto rose from the sofa and began to wander about the room. After
a while he paused and pointed to an antique instrument on one of the
shelves.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he asked.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It looks like an old compass.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He then pointed to an ancient firearm hanging on the wall above the
sofa.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;An old-fashioned rifle.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly&mdash;and this?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto pulled a large book off one of the bookshelves.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old book.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To be absolutely precise, it is an incunabulum.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;An incunabulum?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Actually, it means &lsquo;cradle.&rsquo; The word is used
about books printed in the cradle days of printing. That is, before
1500.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it really that old?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That old, yes. And these three discoveries&mdash;the compass,
firearms, and the printing press&mdash;were essential
preconditions for this new period we call the Renaissance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to explain that a bit more clearly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The compass made it easier to navigate. In other words, it was
the basis for the great voyages of discovery. So were firearms
in a way. The new weapons gave the Europeans military superiority
over American and Asiatic cultures, although firearms were also an
important factor in Europe. Printing played an important part in
spreading the Renaissance humanists&rsquo; new ideas. And the art of
printing was, not least, one of the factors that forced the Church to
relinquish its former position as sole disseminator of knowledge. New
inventions and instruments began to follow thick and fast. One
important instrument, for example, was the telescope, which resulted
in a completely new basis for astronomy.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And finally came rockets and space probes.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re going too fast. But you could say that a
process started in the Renaissance finally brought people to the
moon. Or for that matter to Hiroshima and Chernobyl. However, it all
began with changes on the cultural and economic front. An important
condition was the transition from a subsistence economy to a monetary
economy. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, cities had developed,
with effective trades and a lively commerce of new goods, a monetary
economy and banking. A middle class arose which developed a
certain freedom with regard to the basic conditions of life.
Necessities became something that could be bought for money. This
state of affairs rewarded people&rsquo;s diligence, imagination, and
ingenuity. New demands were made on the individual.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit like the way Greek cities developed two
thousand years earlier.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not altogether untrue. I told you how Greek philosophy broke
away from the mythological world picture that was linked to peasant
culture. In the same way, the Renaissance middle class began to break
away from the feudal lords and the power of the church. As this was
happening, Greek culture was being rediscovered through a closer
contact with the Arabs in Spain and the Byzantine culture in the
east.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The three diverging streams from antiquity joined into one
great river.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are an attentive pupil. That gives you some background on
the Renaissance. I shall now tell you about the new ideas.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, but I&rsquo;ll have to go home and eat.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto sat down on the sofa again. He looked at Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Above all else, the Renaissance resulted in a new view of
mankind. The humanism of the Renaissance brought a new belief in man
and his worth, in striking contrast to the biased medieval emphasis
on the sinful nature of man. Man was now considered infinitely great
and valuable. One of the central figures of the Renaissance was
Marsilio Ficino, who exclaimed: &lsquo;Know thyself, O divine
lineage in mortal guise!&rsquo; Another central figure, Pica della
Mirandola, wrote the Oration on the Dignity of Man, something that
would have been unthinkable in the Middle Ages.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Throughout the whole medieval period, the point of departure
had always been God. The humanists of the Renaissance took as their
point of departure man himself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But so did the Greek philosophers.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is precisely why we speak of a &lsquo;rebirth&rsquo; of
antiquity&rsquo;s humanism. But Renaissance humanism was to an
even greater extent characterized by individualism. We are not only
human beings, we are unique individuals. This idea could then
lead to an almost unrestrained worship of genius. The ideal became
what we call the Renaissance man, a man of universal genius embracing
all aspects of life, art, and science. The new view of man also
manifested itself in an interest in the human anatomy. As in ancient
times, people once again began to dissect the dead to discover how
the body was constructed. It was imperative both for medical
science and for art. Once again it became usual for works of art to
depict the nude. High time, after a thousand years of prudery. Man
was bold enough to be himself again. There was no longer anything to
be ashamed of.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It sounds intoxicating,&rdquo; said Sophie, leaning her arms
on the little table that stood between her and the philosopher.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Undeniably. The new view of mankind led to a whole new
outlook. Man did not exist purely for God&rsquo;s sake. Man could
therefore delight in life here and now. And with this new freedom to
develop, the possibilities were limitless. The aim was now to exceed
all boundaries. This was also a new idea, seen from the Greek
humanistic point of view; the humanists of antiquity had emphasized
the importance of tranquility, moderation, and restraint.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And the Renaissance humanists lost their restraint?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They were certainly not especially moderate. They behaved as
if the whole world had been reawakened.</P>
<p>
They became intensely conscious of their epoch, which is what led
them to introduce the term &lsquo;Middle Ages&rsquo; to cover the
centuries between antiquity and their own time. There was an
unrivaled development in all spheres of life. Art and architecture,
literature, music, philosophy, and science flourished as never
before. I will mention one concrete example. We have spoken of
Ancient Rome, which gloried in titles such as the &lsquo;city of
cities&rsquo; and the &lsquo;hub of the universe.&rsquo; During the
Middle Ages the city declined, and by 1417 the old metropolis had
only 17,000 inhabitants.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not much more than Lillesand, where Hilde lives.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Renaissance humanists saw it as their cultural duty to
restore Rome: first and foremost, to begin the construction of the
great St. Peter&rsquo;s Church over the grave of Peter the Apostle.
And St. Peter&rsquo;s Church can boast neither of moderation nor
restraint. Many great artists of the Renaissance took part in this
building project, the greatest in the world. It began in 1506
and lasted for a hundred and twenty years, and it took another fifty
before the huge St. Peter&rsquo;s Square was completed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It must be a gigantic church!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is over 200 meters long and 130 meters high, and it covers
an area of more than 16,000 square meters. But enough about the
boldness of Renaissance man. It was also significant that the
Renaissance brought with it a new view of nature. The fact that man
felt at home in the world and did not consider life solely as a
preparation for the hereafter, created a whole new approach to
the physical world. Nature was now regarded as a positive thing.
Many held the view that God was also present in his creation. If
he is indeed infinite, he must be present in everything. This idea is
called pantheism. The medieval philosophers had insisted that there
is an insurmountable barrier between God and the Creation. It
could now be said that nature is divine&mdash;and even that it is
&lsquo;God&rsquo;s blossoming.&rsquo; Ideas of this kind were not
always looked kindly on by the church. The fate of Gior-dano Bruno
was a dramatic example of this. Not only did he claim that God was
present in nature, he also believed that the universe was infinite in
scope. He was punished very severely for his ideas.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He was burned at the stake in Rome&rsquo;s Flower Market
in the year 1600.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How horrible ... and stupid. And you call that humanism?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not at all. Bruno was the humanist, not his executioners.
During the Renaissance, what we call anti-humanism flourished as
well. By this I mean the authoritarian power of State and Church.
During the Renaissance there was a tremendous thirst for trying
witches, burning heretics, magic and superstition, bloody religious
wars&mdash;and not least, the brutal conquest of America. But
humanism has always had a shadow side. No epoch is either purely good
or purely evil. Good and evil are twin threads that run through the
history of mankind. And often they intertwine. This is not least
true of our next key phrase, a new scientific method, another
Renaissance innovation which I will tell you about.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was that when they built the first factories?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not yet. But a precondition for all the technical
development that took place after the Renaissance was the new
scientific method. By that I mean the completely new approach to what
science was. The technical fruits of this method only became apparent
later on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What was this new method?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Mainly it was a process of investigating nature with our own
senses. Since the fourteenth century there had been an increasing
number of thinkers who warned against blind faith in old authority,
be it religious doctrine or the natural philosophy of Aristotle.
There were also warnings against the belief that problems can be
solved purely by thinking. An exaggerated belief in the importance of
reason had been valid all through the Middle Ages. Now it was
said that every investigation of natural phenomena must be based on
observation, experience, and experiment. We call this the
empirical method.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Which means?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It only means that one bases one&rsquo;s knowledge of things
on one&rsquo;s own experience&mdash;and not on dusty parchments or
figments of the imagination. Empirical science was known in
antiquity, but systematic experiments were something quite new.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I guess they didn&rsquo;t have any of the technical apparatus
we have today.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course they had neither calculators nor electronic scales.
But they had mathematics and they had scales. And it was now above
all imperative to express scientific observations in precise
mathematical terms. &lsquo;Measure what can be measured, and make
measurable what cannot be measured,&rsquo; said the Italian
Galileo Galilei, who was one of the most important scientists of the
seventeenth century. He also said that the book of nature is
written in the language of mathematics.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And all these experiments and measurements made new inventions
possible.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The first phase was a new scientific method. This made the
technical revolution itself possible, and the technical breakthrough
opened the way for every invention since. You could say that man
had begun to break away from his natural condition. Nature was no
longer something man was simply a part of. &lsquo;Knowledge is
power,&rsquo; said the English philosopher Francis Bacon, thereby
underlining the practical value of knowledge&mdash; and this was
indeed new. Man was seriously starting to intervene in nature and
beginning to control it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But not only in a good way?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, this is what I was referring to before when I spoke of the
good and the evil threads that are constantly intertwined in
everything we do. The technical revolution that began in the
Renaissance led to the spinning jenny and to unemployment, to
medicines and new diseases, to the improved efficiency of
agriculture and the impoverishment of the environment, to practical
appliances such as the washing machine and the refrigerator and
pollution and industrial waste. The serious threat to the environment
we are facing today has made many people see the technical revolution
itself as a perilous maladjustment to natural conditions. It has been
pointed out that we have started something we can no longer control.
More optimistic spirits think we are still living in the cradle of
technology, and that although the scientific age has certainly
had its teething troubles, we will gradually learn to control nature
without at the same time threatening its very existence and thus our
own.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Which do you think?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think perhaps there may be some truth in both views. In some
areas we must stop interfering with nature, but in others we can
succeed. One thing is certain: There is no way back to the Middle
Ages. Ever since the Renaissance, mankind has been more than just
part of creation. Man has begun to intervene in nature and form it
after his own image. In truth, &lsquo;what a piece of work is man!&rsquo;
&ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We have already been to the moon. What medieval person would
have believed such a thing possible?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s for sure. Which brings us to the new world
view. All through the Middle Ages people had stood beneath the sky
and gazed up at the sun, the moon, the stars, and the planets. But
nobody had doubted that the earth was the center of the universe. No
observations had sown any doubt that the earth remained still while
the &lsquo;heavenly bodies&rsquo; traveled in their orbits around it.
We call this the geocentric world picture, or in other words, the
belief that everything revolves around the earth. The Christian
belief that God ruled from on high, up above all the heavenly bodies,
also contributed to maintaining this world picture.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish it were that simple!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But in 1543 a little book was published entitled On the
Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres. It was written by the Polish
astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who died on the day the book was
published. Copernicus claimed that it was not the sun that moved
round the earth, it was vice versa. He thought this was completely
possible from the observations of the heavenly bodies that existed.
The reason people had always believed that the sun went round the
earth was that the earth turns on its own axis, he said. He pointed
out that all observations of heavenly bodies were far easier to
understand if one assumed that both the earth and the other planets
circle around the sun. We call this the heliocentric world picture,
which means that everything centers around the sun.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that world picture was the right one?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not entirely. His main point&mdash;that the earth moves round
the sun&mdash;is of course correct. But he claimed that the sun was
the center of the universe. Today we know that the sun is only one of
an infinite number of stars, and that all the stars around us make up
only one of many billions of galaxies. Copernicus also believed that
the earth and the other planets moved in circular orbits around the
sun.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No. He had nothing on which to base his belief in the circular
orbits other than the ancient idea that heavenly bodies were
round and moved in circles simply because they were &lsquo;heavenly.&rsquo;
Since the time of Plato the sphere and the circle had been considered
the most perfect geometrical figures. But in the early 1600s,
the German astronomer Johannes Kepler presented the results of
comprehensive observations which showed that the planets move in
elliptical&mdash;or oval&mdash;orbits with the sun at one focus. He
also pointed out that the speed of a planet is greatest when it is
closest to the sun, and that the farther a planet&rsquo;s orbit is
from the sun the slower it moves. Not until Kepler&rsquo;s time was
it actually stated that the earth was a planet just like other
planets. Kepler also emphasized that the same physical laws apply
everywhere throughout the universe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How could he know that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because he had investigated the movements of the planets with
his own senses instead of blindly trusting ancient superstitions.
Galileo Galilei, who was roughly contemporary with Kepler, also used
a telescope to observe the heavenly bodies. He studied the
moon&rsquo;s craters and said that the moon had mountains and valleys
similar to those on earth. Moreover, he discovered that the
planet Jupiter had four moons. So the earth was not alone in having a
moon. But the greatest significance of Galileo was that he first
formulated the so-called Law of Inertia.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Galileo formulated it thus: A body remains in the state which
it is in, at rest or in motion, as long as no external force compels
it to change its state.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But this was a significant observation. Since antiquity,
one of the central arguments against the earth moving round its own
axis was that the earth would then move so quickly that a stone
hurled straight into the air would fall yards away from the spot it
was hurled from.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So why doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sitting in a train and you drop an apple, it
doesn&rsquo;t fall backward because the train is moving. It falls
straight down. That is because of the law of inertia. The apple
retains exactly the same speed it had before you dropped it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I understand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now in Galileo&rsquo;s time there were no trains. But if you
roll a ball along the ground&mdash;and suddenly let go...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;... it goes on rolling ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;... because it retains its speed after you let go.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it will stop eventually, if the room is long enough.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because other forces slow it down. First, the
floor, especially if it is a rough wooden floor. Then the force of
gravity will sooner or later bring it to a halt. But wait, I&rsquo;ll
show you something.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto Knox got up and went over to the old desk. He took something
out of one of the drawers. When he returned to his place he put it on
the coffee table. It was just a wooden board, a few millimeters thick
at one end and thin at the other. Beside the board, which almost
covered the whole table, he laid a green marble.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is called an inclined plane,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What
do you think will happen if I let go the marble up here, where the
plane is thickest?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie sighed resignedly.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I bet you ten crowns it rolls down onto the table and ends on
the floor.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto let go of the marble and it behaved exactly as Sophie had
said. It rolled onto the table, over the tabletop, hit the floor with
a little thud and finally bumped into the wall.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Impressive,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, wasn&rsquo;t it! This was the kind of experiment Galileo
did, you see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was he really that stupid?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Patience! He wanted to investigate things with all his senses,
so we have only just begun. Tell me first why the marble rolled down
the inclined plane.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It began to roll because it was heavy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All right. And what is weight actually, child?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a silly question.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a silly question if you can&rsquo;t answer it.
Why did the marble roll onto the floor?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because of gravity.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly&mdash;or gravitation, as we also say. Weight has
something to do with gravity. That was the force that set the marble
in motion.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto had already picked the marble up from the floor. He stood
bowed over the inclined plane with the marble again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now I shall try to roll the marble across the plane,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Watch carefully how it moves.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie watched as the marble gradually curved away and was drawn down
the incline.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It rolled sloping because the board is sloping.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to brush the marble with ink ... then
perhaps we can study exactly what you mean by sloping.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He dug out an ink brush and painted the whole marble black. Then he
rolled it again. Now Sophie could see exactly where on the plane the
marble had rolled because it had left a black line on the board.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How would you describe the marble&rsquo;s path?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s curved ... it looks like part of a circle.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto looked up at her and raised his eyebrows.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;However, it is not quite a circle. This figure is called a
parabola.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine with me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but why did the marble travel in precisely that way?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie thought deeply. Then she said, &ldquo;Because the board was
sloping, the marble was drawn toward the floor by the force of
gravity.&rdquo;-</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes! This is nothing less than a sensation! Here I go,
dragging a girl who&rsquo;s not yet fifteen up to my attic, and she
realizes exactly the same thing Galileo did after one single
experiment!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He clapped his hands. For a moment Sophie was afraid he had gone mad.
He continued: &ldquo;You saw what happened when two forces worked
simultaneously on the same object. Galileo discovered that the same
thing applied, for instance, to a cannonball. It is propelled into
the air, it continues its path over the earth, but will eventually
be drawn toward the earth. So it will have described a
trajectory corresponding to the marble&rsquo;s path across the
inclined plane. And this was actually a new discovery at the time of
Galileo. Aristotle thought that a projectile hurled obliquely into
the air would first describe a gentle curve and then fall
vertically to the earth. This was not so, but nobody could know
Aristotle was wrong before it had been demonstrated.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does all this really matter?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does it matter? You bet it matters! This has cosmic
significance, my child. Of all the scientific discoveries in the
history of mankind, this is positively the most important.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you are going to tell me why.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then along came the English physicist Isaac Newton, who
lived from 1642 to 1727. He was the one who provided the final
description of the solar system and the planetary orbits. Not only
could he describe how the planets moved round the sun, he could also
explain why they did so. He was able to do so partly by referring to
what we call Galileo&rsquo;s dynamics.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are the planets marbles on an inclined plane then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Something like that, yes. But wait a bit, Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Do I have a choice?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kepler had already pointed out that there had to be a force
that caused the heavenly bodies to attract each other. There had to
be, for example, a solar force which held the planets fast in their
orbits. Such a force would moreover explain why the planets moved
more slowly in their orbit the further away from the sun they
traveled. Kepler also believed that the ebb and flow of the tides&mdash;
the rise and fall in sea level&mdash;must be the result of a lunar
force.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true. But it was a theory Galileo rejected. He
mocked Kepler, who he said had given his approval to the idea that
the moon rules the water. That was because Galileo rejected the
idea that the forces of gravitation could work over great
distances, and also between the heavenly bodies.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He was wrong there.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. On that particular point he was wrong. And that was
funny, really, because he was very preoccupied with the earth&rsquo;s
gravity and falling bodies. He had even indicated how increased
force can control the movement of a body.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you were talking about Newton.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, along came Newton. He formulated what we call the Law of
Universal Gravitation. This law states that every object attracts
every other object with a force that increases in proportion to the
size of the objects and decreases in proportion to the distance
between the objects.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I understand. For example, there is greater attraction
between two elephants than there is between two mice. And there is
greater attraction between two elephants in the same zoo than there
is between an Indian elephant in India and an African elephant
in Africa.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then you have understood it. And now comes the central point.
Newton proved that this attraction&mdash;or gravitation&mdash;is
universal, which means it is operative everywhere, also in space
between heavenly bodies. He is said to have gotten this idea while he
was sitting under an apple tree. When he saw an apple fall from the
tree he had to ask himself if the moon was drawn to earth with the
same force, and if this was the reason why the moon continued to
orbit the earth to all eternity.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Smart. But not so smart really.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, if the moon was drawn to the earth with the same force
that causes the apple to fall, one day the moon would come crashing
to earth instead of going round and round it for ever.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Which brings us to Newton&rsquo;s law on planetary orbits.
In the case of how the earth attracts the moon, you are fifty percent
right but fifty percent wrong. Why doesn&rsquo;t the moon fall to
earth? Because it really is true that the earth&rsquo;s gravitational
force attracting the moon is tremendous. Just think of the force
required to lift sea level a meter or two at high tide.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember Galileo&rsquo;s inclined plane. What happened when I
rolled the marble across it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are there two different forces working on the moon?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. Once upon a time when the solar system began, the
moon was hurled outward&mdash;outward from the earth, that is&mdash;with
tremendous force. This force will remain in effect forever because it
moves in a vacuum without resistance...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it is also attracted to the earth because of earth&rsquo;s
gravitational force, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. Both forces are constant, and both work
simultaneously. Therefore the moon will continue to orbit the
earth.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it really as simple as that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As simple as that, and this very same simplicity was Newton&rsquo;s
whole point. He demonstrated that a few natural laws apply to
the whole universe. In calculating the planetary orbits he had merely
applied two natural laws which Galileo had already proposed. One was
the law of inertia, which Newton expressed thus: &lsquo;A body
remains in its state of rest or rectilinear motion until it is
compelled to change that state by a force impressed on it.&rsquo; The
other law had been demonstrated by Galileo on an inclined plane: When
two forces work on a body simultaneously, the body will move on an
elliptical path.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s how Newton could explain why all the planets
go round the sun.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. All the planets travel in elliptical orbits round the sun
as the result of two unequal movements: first, the rectilinear
movement they had when the solar system was formed, and second, the
movement toward the sun due to gravitation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Very clever.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Very. Newton demonstrated that the same laws of moving bodies
apply everywhere in the entire universe. He thus did away with the
medieval belief that there is one set of laws for heaven and another
here on earth. The heliocentric world view had found its final
confirmation and its final explanation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto got up and put the inclined plane away again. He picked up
the marble and placed it on the table between them.</P>
<p>
Sophie thought it was amazing how much they had gotten out of a bit
of slanting wood and a marble. As she looked at the green marble,
which was still smudged with ink, she couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of
the earth&rsquo;s globe. She said, &ldquo;And people just had to
accept that they were living on a random planet somewhere in space?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the new world view was in many ways a great burden.
The situation was comparable to what happened later on when Darwin
proved that mankind had developed from animals. In both cases
mankind lost some of its special status in creation. And in both
cases the Church put up a massive resistance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can well understand that. Because where was God in all this
new stuff? It was simpler when the earth was the center and God and
the planets were upstairs.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But that was not the greatest challenge. When Newton had
proved that the same natural laws applied everywhere in the
universe, one might think that he thereby undermined people&rsquo;s
faith in God&rsquo;s omnipotence. But Newton&rsquo;s own faith was
never shaken. He regarded the natural laws as proof of the existence
of the great and almighty God. It&rsquo;s possible that man&rsquo;s
picture of himself fared worse.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Since the Renaissance, people have had to get used to living
their life on a random planet in the vast galaxy. I am not sure we
have wholly accepted it even now. But there were those even in the
Renaissance who said that every single one of us now had a more
central position than before.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Formerly, the earth was the center of the world. But since
astronomers now said that there was no absolute center to the
universe, it came to be thought that there were just as many centers
as there were people. Each person could be the center of a universe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I think I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Renaissance resulted in a new religiosity. As philosophy
and science gradually broke away from theology, a new Christian
piety developed. Then the Renaissance arrived with its new view
of man. This had its effect on religious life. The individual&rsquo;s
personal relationship to God was now more important than his
relationship to the church as an organization.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like saying one&rsquo;s prayers at night, for instance?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that too. In the medieval Catholic Church, the church&rsquo;s
liturgy in Latin and the church&rsquo;s ritual prayers had been the
backbone of the religious service. Only priests and monks read the
Bible because it only existed in Latin. But during the Renaissance,
the Bible was translated from Hebrew and Greek into national
languages. It was central to what we call the Reformation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Martin Luther...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Martin Luther was important, but he was not the only
reformer. There were also ecclesiastical reformers who chose to
remain within the Roman Catholic church. One of them was Erasmus of
Rotterdam.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Luther broke with the Catholic Church because he wouldn&rsquo;t
buy indulgences, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that was one of the reasons. But there was a more
important reason. According to Luther, people did not need the
intercession of the church or its priests in order to receive God&rsquo;s
forgiveness. Neither was God&rsquo;s forgiveness dependent on the
buying of &lsquo;indulgences&rsquo; from the church. Trading in these
so-called letters of indulgence was forbidden by the Catholic Church
from the middle of the sixteenth century.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;God was probably glad of that.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In general, Luther distanced himself from many of the
religious customs and dogmas that had become rooted in ecclesiastical
history during the Middle Ages. He wanted to return to early
Christianity as it was in the New Testament. The Scripture alone,&rsquo;
he said. With this slogan Luther wished to return to the &lsquo;source&rsquo;
of Christianity, just as the Renaissance humanists had wanted to
turn to the ancient sources of art and culture. Luther translated the
Bible into German, thereby founding the German written language. He
believed every man should be able to read the Bible and thus in a
sense become his own priest.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;His own priest? Wasn&rsquo;t that taking it a bit far?&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What he meant was that priests had no preferential position in
relation to God. The Lutheran congregations employed priests for
practical reasons, such as conducting services and attending to
the daily clerical tasks, but Luther did not believe that anyone
received God&rsquo;s forgiveness and redemption from sin through
church rituals. Man received &lsquo;free&rsquo; redemption through
faith alone, he said. This was a belief he arrived at by reading the
Bible.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So Luther was also a typical Renaissance man?&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes and no. A characteristic Renaissance feature was his
emphasis on the individual and the individual&rsquo;s personal
relationship to God. So he taught himself Greek at the age of
thirty-five and began the laborious job of translating the Bible from
the ancient Greek version into German. Allowing the language of the
people to take precedence over Latin was also a characteristic
Renaissance feature. But Luther was not a humanist like Ficino
or Leonardo da Vinci. He was also opposed by humanists such as
Erasmus of Rotterdam because they thought his view of man was far too
negative; Luther had proclaimed that mankind was totally depraved
after the Fall from Grace. Only through the grace of God could
mankind be &lsquo;justified,&rsquo; he believed. For the wages
of sin is death.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That sounds very gloomy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto Knox rose. He picked up the little green and black marble and
put it in his top pocket.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s after four!&rdquo; Sophie exclaimed in horror.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And the next great epoch in the history of mankind is the
Baroque. But we shall have to keep that for another day, my dear
Hilde.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Sophie shot up from the chair she had
been sitting in. &ldquo;You called me Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was a serious slip of the tongue.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But a slip of the tongue is never wholly accidental.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You may be right. You&rsquo;ll notice that Hilde&rsquo;s
father has begun to put words in our mouths. I think he is exploiting
the fact that we are getting weary and are not defending ourselves
very well.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You said once that you are not Hilde&rsquo;s father. Is that
really true?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto nodded.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But am I Hilde?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired now, Sophie. You have to understand that. We
have been sitting here for over two hours, and I have been doing most
of the talking. Don&rsquo;t you have to go home to eat?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie felt almost as if he was trying to throw her out. As she went
into the little hall, she thought intensely about why he had made
that slip. Alberto came out after her.</P>
<p>
Hermes was lying asleep under a small row of pegs on which hung
several strange-looking garments that could have been theatrical
costumes. Alberto nodded toward the dog and said, &ldquo;He will
come and fetch you.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you for my lesson,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
She gave Alberto an impulsive hug. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best and
kindest philosophy teacher I&rsquo;ve ever had,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
With that she opened the door to the staircase. As the door closed,
Alberto said, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long before we meet again,
Hilde.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie was left with those words.</P>
<p>
Another slip of the tongue, the villain! Sophie had a strong desire
to turn around and hammer on the door but something held her back.</P>
<p>
On reaching the street she remembered that she had no money on her.
She would have to walk all the long way home. How annoying! Her
mother would be both angry and worried if she didn&rsquo;t get back
by six, that was for sure.</P>
<p>
She had not gone more than a few yards when she suddenly noticed a
coin on the sidewalk. It was ten crowns, exactly the price of a bus
ticket.</P>
<p>
Sophie found her way to the bus stop and waited for a bus to the Main
Square. From there she could take a bus on the same ticket and ride
almost to her door.</P>
<p>
Not until she was standing at the Main Square waiting for the second
bus did she begin to wonder why she had been lucky enough to find the
coin just when she needed it.</P>
<p>
Could Hilde&rsquo;s father have left it there? He was a master
at leaving things in the most convenient places.</P>
<p>
How could he, if he was in Lebanon?</P>
<p>
And why had Alberto made that slip? Not once but twice!</P>
<p>
Sophie shivered. She felt a chill run down her spine.</P>
<br /><h3>The Baroque</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;such stuff as dreams are made on&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie heard nothing more from Alberto for several days, but she
glanced frequently into the garden hoping to catch sight of Hermes.
She told her mother that the dog had found its own way home and that
she had been invited in by its owner, a former physics teacher. He
had told Sophie about the solar system and the new science that
developed in the sixteenth century.</P>
<p>
She told Joanna more. She told her all about her visit to Alberto,
the postcard in the mailbox, and the ten-crown piece she had found on
the way home. She kept the dream about Hilde and the gold crucifix to
herself.</P>
<p>
On Tuesday, May 29, Sophie was standing in the kitchen doing the
dishes. Her mother had gone into the living room to watch the TV
news. When the opening theme faded out she heard from the kitchen
that a major in the Norwegian UN Battalion had been killed by a
shell.</P>
<p>
Sophie threw the dish towel on the table and rushed into the living
room. She was just in time to catch a glimpse of the UN officer&rsquo;s
face for a few seconds before they switched to the next item.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; she cried.</P>
<p>
Her mother turned to her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, war is a terrible thing!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie burst into tears.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But Sophie, it&rsquo;s not that bad!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Did they say his name?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t remember it. He was from Grimstad, I
think.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the same as Lillesand?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re being silly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But if you come from Grimstad, you might go to school in
Lillesand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She had stopped crying, but now it was her mother&rsquo;s turn to
react. She got out of her chair and switched off the TV.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, there is. You have a boyfriend, and I&rsquo;m beginning
to think he&rsquo;s much older than you. Answer me now: Do you know a
man in Lebanon?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not exactly...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you met the son of someone in Lebanon?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t even met his daughter.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Whose daughter?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think it is.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe I should start asking some questions instead. Why is Dad
never home? Is it because you haven&rsquo;t got the guts to get a
divorce? Maybe you&rsquo;ve got a boyfriend you don&rsquo;t want Dad
and me to know about and so on and so on. I&rsquo;ve got plenty of
questions of my own.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think we need to talk.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That may be. But right now I&rsquo;m so worn out I&rsquo;m
going to bed. And I&rsquo;m getting my period.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie ran up to her room; she felt like crying.</P>
<p>
As soon as she was through in the bathroom and had curled up under
the covers, her mother came into the bedroom.</P>
<p>
Sophie pretended to be asleep even though she knew her mother
wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. She knew her mother knew that Sophie knew
her mother wouldn&rsquo;t believe it either. Nevertheless her mother
pretended to believe that Sophie was asleep. She sat on the edge of
Sophie&rsquo;s bed and stroked her hair.</P>
<p>
Sophie was thinking how complicated it was to live two lives at the
same time. She began to look forward to the end of the philosophy
course. Maybe it would be over by her birthday&mdash;or at least by
Midsummer Eve, when Hilde&rsquo;s father would be home from Lebanon
...</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I want to have a birthday party,&rdquo; she said suddenly.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That sounds great. Who will you invite?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Lots of people ... Can I?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course. We have a big garden. Hopefully the good weather
will continue.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Most of all I&rsquo;d like to have it on Midsummer Eve.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All right, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very important day,&rdquo; Sophie said, thinking
not only of her birthday.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is, indeed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I feel I&rsquo;ve grown up a lot lately.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie had been talking with her head almost buried in her pillow.
Now her mother said, &ldquo;Sophie&mdash;you must tell me why you
seem so out of balance at the moment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you like this when you were fifteen?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Probably. But you know what I am talking about.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie suddenly turned to face her mother. &ldquo;The dog&rsquo;s
name is Hermes,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It belongs to a man called Alberto.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He lives down in the Old Town.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You went all that way with the dog?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing dangerous about that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You said that the dog had often been here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did I say that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She had to think now. She wanted to tell as much as possible, but she
couldn&rsquo;t tell everything.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hardly ever at home,&rdquo; she ventured.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m much too busy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Alberto and Hermes have been here lots of times.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What for? Were they in the house as well?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you at least ask one question at a time? They
haven&rsquo;t been in the house. But they often go for walks in the
woods. Is that so mysterious?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not in the least.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They walk past our gate like everyone else when they go for a
walk. One day when I got home from school I talked to the dog. That&rsquo;s
how I got to know Alberto.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What about the white rabbit and all that stuff?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was something Alberto said. He is a real philosopher,
you see. He has told me about all the philosophers.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Just like that, over the hedge?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He has also written letters to me, lots of times, actually.
Sometimes he has sent them by mail and other times he has just
dropped them in the mailbox on his way out for a walk.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So that was the &lsquo;love letter&rsquo; we talked about.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Except that it wasn&rsquo;t a love letter.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And he only wrote about philosophy?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, can you imagine! And I&rsquo;ve learned more from him
than I have learned in eight years of school. For instance, have you
ever heard of Giordano Bruno, who was burned at the stake in 1600? Or
of Newton&rsquo;s Law of Universal Gravitation?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s a lot I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I bet you don&rsquo;t even know why the earth orbits the
sun&mdash;and it&rsquo;s your own planet!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;About how old is this man?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no idea&mdash;about fifty, probably.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But what is his connection with Lebanon?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
This was a tough one. Sophie thought hard. She chose the most likely
story.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Alberto has a brother who&rsquo;s a major in the UN
Battalion. And he&rsquo;s from Lillesand. Maybe he&rsquo;s the
major who once lived in the major&rsquo;s cabin.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Alberto&rsquo;s a funny kind of name, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It sounds Italian.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, nearly everything that&rsquo;s important comes either
from Greece or from Italy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But he speaks Norwegian?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, fluently.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You know what, Sophie&mdash;I think you should invite</P>
<p>
Alberto home one day. I have never met a real philosopher.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe we could invite him to your birthday party? It could be
such fun to mix the generations. Then maybe I could come too. At
least, I could help with the serving. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a good
idea?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If he will. At any rate, he&rsquo;s more interesting to talk
to than the boys in my class. It&rsquo;s just that...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d probably flip and think Alberto was my new
boyfriend.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then you just tell them he isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we shall. And Sophie&mdash;it is true that things haven&rsquo;t
always been easy between Dad and me. But there was never anyone else
...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have to sleep now. I&rsquo;ve got such awful cramps.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you want an aspirin?&rdquo; /&rsquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
When her mother returned with the pill and a glass of water Sophie
had fallen asleep.</P>
<p>
May 31 was a Thursday. Sophie agonized through the afternoon classes
at school. She was doing better in some subjects since she started on
the philosophy course. Usually her grades were good in most subjects,
but lately they were even better, except in math.</P>
<p>
In the last class they got an essay handed back. Sophie had written
on &ldquo;Man and Technology.&rdquo; She had written reams on the
Renaissance and the scientific breakthrough, the new view of
nature and Francis Bacon, who had said that knowledge was power. She
had been very careful to point out that the empirical method came
before the technological discoveries. Then she had written about
some of the things she could think of about technology that were
not so good for society. She ended with a paragraph on the fact that
everything people do can be used for good or evil. Good and evil are
like a white and a black thread that make up a single strand.</P>
<p>
Sometimes they are so closely intertwined that it is impossible
to untangle them.</P>
<p>
As the teacher gave out the exercise books he looked down at Sophie
and winked.</P>
<p>
She got an A and the comment: &ldquo;Where do you get all this from?&rdquo;
As he stood there, she took out a pen and wrote with block letters in
the margin of her exercise book: I&rsquo;M STUDYING PHILOSOPHY.</P>
<p>
As she was closing the exercise book again, something fell out of it.
It was a postcard from Lebanon:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, When you read this we shall already have spoken together
by phone about the tragic death down here. Sometimes I ask myself if
war could have been avoided if people had been a bit better at
thinking. Perhaps the best remedy against violence would be a short
course in philosophy. What about &ldquo;the UN&rsquo;s little
philosophy book&rdquo;&mdash; which all new citizens of the world
could be given a copy of in their own language. I&rsquo;ll propose
the idea to the UN General Secretary.</P>
<p>
You said on the phone that you were getting better at looking
after your things. I&rsquo;m glad, because you&rsquo;re the untidiest
creature I&rsquo;ve ever met. Then you said the only thing you&rsquo;d
lost since we last spoke was ten crowns. I&rsquo;ll do what I can to
help you find it. Although I am far away, I have a helping hand
back home. (If I find the money I&rsquo;ll put it in with your
birthday present.) Love, Dad, who feels as if he&rsquo;s already
started the long trip home.</P>
<p>
Sophie had just managed to finish reading the card when the last bell
rang. Once again her thoughts were in turmoil.</P>
<p>
Joanna was waiting in the playground. On the way home Sophie opened
her schoolbag and showed Joanna the latest card.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When is it postmarked?&rdquo; asked Joanna.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Probably June 15 ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, look ... 5/30/90, it says.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;That was yesterday ... the day after the death of the major
in Lebanon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I doubt if a postcard from Lebanon can get to Norway in
one day,&rdquo; said Joanna.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Especially not considering the rather unusual address:
Hilde Moller Knag, c/o Sophie Amundsen, Fu-rulia Junior High
School...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you think it could have come by mail? And the teacher just
popped it in your exercise book?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No idea. I don&rsquo;t know whether I dare ask either.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
No more was said about the postcard.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a garden party on Midsummer Eve,&rdquo;
said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;With boys?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to invite
the worst idiots.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you are going to invite Jeremy?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you want. By the way, I might invite Alberto Knox.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You must be crazy!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
That was as far as the conversation got before their ways parted at
the supermarket.</P>
<p>
The first thing Sophie did when she got home was to see if Hermes was
in the garden. Sure enough, there he was, sniffing around the apple
trees.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hermes!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The dog stood motionless for a second. Sophie knew exactly what was
going on in that second: the dog heard her call, recognized her
voice, and decided to see if she was there. Then, discovering her, he
began to run toward her. Finally all four legs came pattering like
drumsticks.</P>
<p>
That was actually quite a lot in the space of one second.</P>
<p>
He dashed up to her, wagged his tail wildly, and jumped up to lick
her face.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hermes, clever boy! Down, down. No, stop slobbering all
over me. Heel, boy! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie let herself into the house. Sherekan came jumping out from the
bushes. He was rather wary of the stranger. Sophie put his cat food
out, poured birdseed in the budgerigars&rsquo; cup, got out a salad
leaf for the tortoise, and wrote a note to her mother.</P>
<p>
She wrote that she was going to take Hermes home and would be back by
seven.</P>
<p>
They set off through the town. Sophie had remembered to take
some money with her this time. She wondered whether she ought to
take the bus with Hermes, but decided she had better wait and ask
Alberto about it.</P>
<p>
While she walked on and on behind Hermes she thought about what an
animal really is.</P>
<p>
What was the difference between a dog and a person? She recalled
Aristotle&rsquo;s words. He said that people and animals are both
natural living creatures with a lot of characteristics in common. But
there was one distinct difference between people and animals, and
that was human reasoning.</P>
<p>
How could he have been so sure?</P>
<p>
Democritus, on the other hand, thought people and animals were really
rather alike because both were made up of atoms. And he didn&rsquo;t
think that either people or animals had immortal souls. According to
him, souls were built up of atoms that are spread to the winds when
people die. He was the one who thought a person&rsquo;s soul was
inseparably bound to the brain.</P>
<p>
But how could the soul be made of atoms? The soul wasn&rsquo;t
anything you could touch like the rest of the body. It was something
&ldquo;spiritual.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They were already beyond Main Square and were approaching the
Old Town. When they got to the sidewalk where Sophie had found the
ten crowns, she looked automatically down at the asphalt. And
there, on exactly the same spot where she had bent down and picked up
the money, lay a postcard with the picture side up. The picture
showed a garden with palms and orange trees.</P>
<p>
Sophie bent down and picked up the card. Hermes started growling as
if he didn&rsquo;t like Sophie touching it.</P>
<p>
The card read:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, Life consists of a long chain of coincidences. It is
not altogether unlikely that the ten crowns you lost turned up right
here. Maybe it was found on the square in Lillesand by an old lady
who was waiting for the bus to Kristiansand. From Kris-tiansand she
took the train to visit her grandchildren, and many, many hours
later she lost the coin here on New Square. It is then perfectly
possible that the very same coin was picked up later on that day by a
girl who really needed it to get home by bus. You never can tell,
Hilde, but if it is truly so, then one must certainly ask whether or
not God&rsquo;s providence is behind everything. Love, Dad, who in
spirit is sitting on the dock at home in Lillesand. P.S. I said I
would help you find the ten crowns.</P>
<p>
On the address side it said: &ldquo;Hilde Moller Knag, c/o a casual
passer-by...&rdquo; The postmark was stamped 6/15/90.</P>
<p>
Sophie ran up the stairs after Hermes. As soon as Alberto opened the
door, she said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Out of my way. Here comes the mailman.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She felt she had every reason to be annoyed. Alberto stood aside as
she barged in. Hermes laid himself down under the coat pegs as
before.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Has the major presented another visiting card, my child?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie looked up at him and discovered that he was wearing a
different costume. He had put on a long curled wig and a wide, baggy
suit with a mass of lace. He wore a loud silk scarf at his throat,
and on top of the suit he had thrown a red cape. He also wore white
stockings and thin patent leather shoes with bows. The whole costume
reminded Sophie of pictures she had seen of the court of Louis XIV.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You clown!&rdquo; she said and handed him the card.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hm ... and you really found ten crowns on the same spot where
he planted the card?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He gets ruder all the time. But maybe it&rsquo;s just as
well.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll make it easier to unmask him. But this trick was
both pompous and tasteless. It almost stinks of cheap perfume.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Perfume?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It tries to be elegant but is really a sham. Can&rsquo;t you
see how he has the effrontery to compare his own shabby surveillance
of us with God&rsquo;s providence?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He held up the card. Then he tore it to pieces. So as not to make his
mood worse she refrained from mentioning the card that fell out
of her exercise book at school.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in and sit down. What time is it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And today we are going to talk about the seventeenth
century.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They went into the living room with the sloping walls and the
skylight. Sophie noticed that Alberto had put different objects out
in place of some of those she had seen last time.</P>
<p>
On the coffee table was a small antique casket containing an
assorted collection of lenses for eyeglasses. Beside it lay an open
book. It looked really old.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Sophie asked.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is a first edition of the book of Descartes&rsquo;s
philosophical essays published in 1637 in which his famous
Discourse on Method originally appeared, and one of my most treasured
possessions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And the casket?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It holds an exclusive collection of lenses&mdash;or optical
glass. They were polished by the Dutch philosopher Spinoza
sometime during the mid-1600s. They were extremely costly and
are also among my most valued treasures.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I would probably understand better how valuable these things
are if I knew who Spinoza and Descartes were.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course. But first let us try to familiarize ourselves with
the period they lived in. Have a seat.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They sat in the same places as before, Sophie in the big armchair and
Alberto Knox on the sofa. Between them was the coffee table with the
book and the casket. Alberto removed his wig and laid it on the
writing desk.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We are going to talk about the seventeenth century&mdash;or
what we generally refer to as the Baroque period.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Baroque period? What a strange name.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The word &lsquo;baroque&rsquo; comes from a word that was
first used to describe a pearl of irregular shape. Irregularity
was typical of Baroque art, which was much richer in highly
contrastive forms than the plainer and more harmonious Renaissance
art. The seventeenth century was on the whole characterized by
tensions between irreconcilable contrasts. On the one hand there
was the Renaissance&rsquo;s unremitting optimism&mdash;and on the
other hand there were the many who sought the opposite extreme
in a life of religious seclusion and self-denial. Both in art and in
real life, we meet pompous and flamboyant forms of
self-expression, while at the same time there arose a monastic
movement, turning away from the world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Both proud palaces and remote monasteries, in other words.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you could certainly say that. One of the Baroque
period&rsquo;s favorite sayings was the Latin expression &lsquo;carpe
diem&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;seize the day.&rsquo; Another Latin
expression that was widely quoted was &lsquo;memento mori,&rsquo;
which means &lsquo;Remember that you must die.&rsquo; In art, a
painting could depict an extremely luxurious lifestyle, with a little
skull painted in one corner.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In many senses, the Baroque period was characterized by
vanity or affectation. But at the same time a lot of people were
concerned with the other side of the coin; they were concerned with
the ephemeral nature of things. That is, the fact that all the beauty
that surrounds us must one day perish.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. It is sad to realize that nothing lasts.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You think exactly as many people did in the seventeenth
century. The Baroque period was also an age of conflict in a
political sense. Europe was ravaged by wars. The worst was the Thirty
Years&rsquo; War which raged over most of the continent from 1618 to
1648. In reality it was a series of wars which took a particular toll
on Germany. Not least as a result of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War,</P>
<p>
France gradually became the dominant power in Europe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What were the wars about?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To a great extent they were wars between Protestants and
Catholics. But they were also about political power.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;More or less like in Lebanon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Apart from wars, the seventeenth century was a time of great
class differences. I&rsquo;m sure you have heard of the French
aristocracy and the Court of Versailles. I don&rsquo;t know whether
you have heard much about the poverty of the French people. But any
display of magnificence presupposes a display of power. It has
often been said that the political situation in the Baroque period
was not unlike its art and architecture. Baroque buildings were
typified by a lot of ornate nooks and crannies. In a somewhat similar
fashion the political situation was typified by intrigue,
plotting, and assassinations.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t a Swedish king shot in a theater?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of Gustav III, a good example of the
sort of thing I mean. The assassination of Gustav III wasn&rsquo;t
until 1792, but the circumstances were quite baroque. He was
murdered while attending a huge masked ball.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought he was at the theater.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The great masked ball was held at the Opera. We could say that
the Baroque period in Sweden came to an end with the murder of Gustav
III. During his time there had been a rule of &lsquo;enlightened
despotism,&rsquo; similar to that in the reign of Louis XIV almost a
hundred years earlier. Gustav III was also an extremely vain person
who adored all French ceremony and courtesies. He also loved the
theater...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;... and that was the death of him.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but the theater of the Baroque period was more than an
art form. It was the most commonly employed symbol of the time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A symbol of what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of life, Sophie. I don&rsquo;t know how many times during
the seventeenth century it was said that &lsquo;Life is a theater.&rsquo;
It was very often, anyway. The Baroque period gave birth to modern
theater&mdash;with all its forms of scenery and theatrical
machinery. In the theater one built up an illusion on stage&mdash;to
expose ultimately that the stage play was just an illusion. The
theater thus became a reflection of human life in general. The
theater could show that &lsquo;pride comes before a fall,&rsquo; and
present a merciless portrait of human frailty.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did Shakespeare live in the Baroque period?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He wrote his greatest plays around the year 1600, so he stands
with one foot in the Renaissance and the other in the Baroque.
Shakespeare&rsquo;s work is full of passages about life as a
theater. Would you like to hear some of them?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In As You Like It, he says:</P>
<p>
All the world&rsquo;s a stage, And all the men and women merely
players: They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in
his time plays many parts.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And in Macbeth, he says:</P>
<p>
Life&rsquo;s but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and
frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more; it is a
tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How very pessimistic.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He was preoccupied with the brevity of life. You must have
heard Shakespeare&rsquo;s most famous line?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To be or not to be&mdash;that is the question.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, spoken by Hamlet. One day we are walking around on the
earth&mdash;and the next day we are dead and gone.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thanks, I got the message.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When they were not comparing life to a stage, the Baroque
poets were comparing life to a dream. Shakespeare says, for
example: We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life
is rounded with a sleep...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was very poetic.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Spanish dramatist Calderon de la Barca, who was bom in the
year 1600, wrote a play called Life Is a Dream, in which he says:
&lsquo;What is life? A madness. What is life? An illusion, a shadow,
a story, and the greatest good is little enough, for all life is a
dream ...&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He may be right. We read a play at school. It was called Jeppe
on the Mount.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;By Ludvig Holberg, yes. He was a gigantic figure here in
Scandinavia, marking the transition from the Baroque period to
the Age of Enlightenment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Jeppe falls asleep in a ditch ... and wakes up in the Baron&rsquo;s
bed. So he thinks he only dreamed that he was a poor farmhand. Then
when he falls asleep again they carry him back to the ditch, and he
wakes up again. This time he thinks he only dreamed he was lying in
the Baron&rsquo;s bed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Holberg borrowed this theme from Calderon, and Calderon had
borrowed it from the old Arabian tales, A Thousand and One Nights.
Comparing life to a dream, though, is a theme we find even farther
back in history, not least in India and China. The old Chinese sage
Chuang-tzu, for example, said: Once I dreamed I was a butterfly, and
now I no longer know whether I am Chuang-tzu, who dreamed I was a
butterfly, or whether I am a butterfly dreaming that I am
Chuang-tzu.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it was impossible to prove either way.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We had in Norway a genuine Baroque poet called Fetter Dass,
who lived from 1647 to 1707. On the one hand he was concerned with
describing life as it is here and now, and on the other hand he
emphasized that only God is eternal and constant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;God is God if every land was waste, God is God if every man
were dead.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But in the same hymn he writes about rural life in Northern
Norway&mdash;and about lumpfish, cod, and coal-fish. This is a
typical Baroque feature, describing in the same text the earthly and
the here and now&mdash;and the celestial and the hereafter. It is all
very reminiscent of Plato&rsquo;s distinction between the concrete
world of the senses and the immutable world of ideas.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What about their philosophy?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That too was characterized by powerful struggles between
diametrically opposed modes of thought. As I have already mentioned,
some philosophers believed that what exists is at bottom spiritual in
nature. This standpoint is called idealism. The opposite viewpoint is
called materialism. By this is meant a philosophy which holds that
all real things derive from concrete material substances. Materialism
also had many advocates in the seventeenth century. Perhaps the most
influential was the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes. He believed
that all phenomena, including man and animals, consist exclusively
of particles of matter. Even human consciousness&mdash;or the
soul&mdash;derives from the movement of tiny particles in the brain.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he agreed with what Democritus said two thousand years
before?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Both idealism and materialism are themes you will find all
through the history of philosophy. But seldom have both views been so
clearly present at the same time as in the Baroque. Materialism was
constantly nourished by the new sciences. Newton showed that the same
laws of motion applied to the whole universe, and that all changes in
the natural world&mdash;both on earth and in space&mdash;were
explained by the principles of universal gravitation and the motion
of bodies.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Everything was thus governed by the same unbreakable
laws&mdash;or by the same mechanisms. It is therefore possible in
principle to calculate every natural change with mathematical
precision. And thus Newton completed what we call the
mechanistic world view.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did he imagine the world as one big machine?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He did indeed. The word &lsquo;mechanic&rsquo; comes from the
Greek word &lsquo;mechane,&rsquo; which means machine. It is
remarkable that neither Hobbes nor Newton saw any contradiction
between the mechanistic world picture and belief in God. But this was
not the case for all eighteenth- and nineteenth-century materialists.
The French physician and philosopher La Mettrie wrote a book in the
eighteenth century called L &lsquo;homme machine, which means
&lsquo;Man&mdash;the machine.&rsquo; Just as the leg has muscles to
walk with, so has the brain &lsquo;muscles&rsquo; to think with.
Later on, the French mathematician Laplace expressed an extreme
mechanistic view with this idea: If an intelligence at a given time
had known the position of all particles of matter, &lsquo;nothing
would be unknown, and both future and past would lie open before
their eyes.&rsquo; The idea here was that everything that happens is
predetermined. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s written in the stars&rsquo; that
something will happen. This view is called determinism.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So there was no such thing as free will.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, everything was a product of mechanical processes&mdash;also
our thoughts and dreams. German materialists in the nineteenth
century claimed that the relationship of thought to the brain was
like the relationship of urine to the kidneys and gall to the
liver.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But urine and gall are material. Thoughts aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got hold of something central there. I can tell
you a story about the same thing. A Russian astronaut and a
Russian brain surgeon were once discussing religion. The brain
surgeon was a Christian but the astronaut was not. The astronaut
said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been out in space many times but I&rsquo;ve
never seen God or angels.&rsquo; And the brain surgeon said, &lsquo;And
I&rsquo;ve operated on many clever brains but I&rsquo;ve never seen a
single thought.&rsquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t prove
that thoughts don&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, but it does underline the fact that thoughts are not
things that can be operated on or broken down into ever smaller
parts. It is not easy, for example, to surgically remove a
delusion. It grows too deep, as it were, for surgery. An important
seventeenth-century philosopher named Leibniz pointed out that
the difference between the material and the spiritual is
precisely that the material can be broken up into smaller and smaller
bits, but the soul cannot even be divided into two.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, what kind of scalpel would you use for that?&rdquo;
Alberto simply shook his head. After a while he pointed down at the
table between them and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The two greatest philosophers in the seventeenth century were
Descartes and Spinoza. They too struggled with questions like the
relationship between &lsquo;soul&rsquo; and &lsquo;body,&rsquo; and
we are now going to study them more closely.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go ahead. But I&rsquo;m supposed to be home by seven.&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>Descartes</h3><br />
<p>
... he wanted to clear all the rubble off the site&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Alberto stood up, took off the red cloak, and laid it over a chair.
Then he settled himself once again in the corner of the sofa.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Rene Descartes was born in 1596 and lived in a number of
different European countries at various periods of his life.
Even as a young man he had a strong desire to achieve insight into
the nature of man and the universe. But after studying philosophy he
became increasingly convinced of his own ignorance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like Socrates?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;More or less like him, yes. Like Socrates, he was convinced
that certain knowledge is only attainable through reason. We can
never trust what the old books tell us. We cannot even trust what our
senses tell us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Plato thought that too. He believed that only reason can give
us certain knowledge.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. There is a direct line of descent from Socrates
and Plato via St. Augustine to Descartes. They were all typical
rationalists, convinced that reason was the only path to knowledge.
After comprehensive studies, Descartes came to the conclusion
that the body of knowledge handed down from the Middle Ages was not
necessarily reliable. You can compare him to Socrates, who did not
trust the general views he encountered in the central square of
Athens. So what does one do, Sophie? Can you tell me that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You begin to work out your own philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Right! Descartes decided to travel around Europe, the way
Socrates spent his life talking to people in Athens. He relates
that from then on he meant to confine himself to seeking the wisdom
that was to be found, either within himself or in the &lsquo;great
book of the world.&rsquo; So he joined the army and went to war,
which enabled him to spend periods of time in different parts of
Central Europe. Later he lived for some years in Paris, but in 1629
he went to Holland, where he remained for nearly twenty years working
on his mathematical and philosophic writings.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In 1649 he was invited to Sweden by Queen Christina. But
his sojourn in what he called &lsquo;the land of bears, ice, and
rocks&rsquo; brought on an attack of pneumonia and he died in the
winter of 1650.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he was only 54 when he died.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but he was to have enormous influence on philosophy,
even after his death. One can say without exaggeration that
Descartes was the father of modern philosophy. Following the heady
rediscovery of man and nature in the Renaissance, the need to
assemble contemporary thought into one coherent philosophical
system again presented itself. The first significant system-builder
was Descartes, and he was followed by Spinoza and Leibniz, Locke and
Berkeley, Hume and Kant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by a philosophical system?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I mean a philosophy that is constructed from the ground up and
that is concerned with finding explanations for all the central
questions of philosophy. Antiquity had its great
system-constructors in Plato and Aristotle. The Middle Ages had St.
Thomas Aquinas, who tried to build a bridge between Aristotle&rsquo;s
philosophy and Christian theology. Then came the Renaissance,
with a welter of old and new beliefs about nature and science, God
and man. Not until the seventeenth century did philosophers make any
attempt to assemble the new ideas into a clarified philosophical
system, and the first to attempt it was Descartes. His work was the
forerunner of what was to be philosophy&rsquo;s most important
project in the coming generations. His main concern was with what we
can know, or in other words, certain knowledge. The other great
question that preoccupied him was the relationship between body and
mind. Both these questions were the substance of philosophical
argument for the next hundred and fifty years.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He must have been ahead of his time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but the question belonged to the age. When it came to
acquiring certain knowledge, many of his contemporaries voiced a
total philosophic skepticism. They thought that man should accept
that he knew nothing. But Descartes would not. Had he done so he
would not have been a real philosopher. We can again draw a parallel
with Socrates, who did not accept the skepticism of the Sophists. And
it was in Descartes&rsquo;s lifetime that the new natural sciences
were developing a method by which to provide certain and exact
descriptions of natural processes.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Descartes was obliged to ask himself if there was a similar
certain and exact method of philosophic reflection.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That I can understand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But that was only part of it. The new physics had also raised
the question of the nature of matter, and thus what determines the
physical processes of nature. More and more people argued in favor of
a mechanistic view of nature. But the more mechanistic the physical
world was seen to be, the more pressing became the question of the
relationship between body and soul. Until the seventeenth
century, the soul had commonly been considered as a sort of
&lsquo;breath of life&rsquo; that pervaded all living creatures. The
original meaning of the words &lsquo;soul&rsquo; and &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;
is, in fact, &lsquo;breath&rsquo; and &lsquo;breathing.&rsquo; This
is the case for almost all European languages. To Aristotle, the soul
was something that was present everywhere in the organism as its
&lsquo;life principle&rsquo;&mdash;and therefore could not be
conceived as separate from the body. So he was able to speak of a
plant soul or an animal soul. Philosophers did not introduce any
radical division of soul and body until the seventeenth century. The
reason was that the motions of all material objects&mdash;including
the body, animal or human&mdash;were explained as involving
mechanical processes. But man&rsquo;s soul could surely not be part
of this body machinery, could it? What of the soul, then? An
explanation was required not least of how something &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo;
could start a mechanical process.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange thought, actually.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I decide to lift my arm&mdash;and then, well, the arm lifts
itself. Or I decide to run for a bus, and the next second my legs are
moving. Or I&rsquo;m thinking about something sad, and suddenly I&rsquo;m
crying. So there must be some mysterious connection between body and
consciousness.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was exactly the problem that set Descartes&rsquo;s
thoughts going. Like Plato, he was convinced that there was a sharp
division between &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; and &lsquo;matter.&rsquo; But
as to how the mind influences the body&mdash;or the soul the
body&mdash;Plato could not provide an answer.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Neither have I, so I am looking forward to hearing what
Descartes&rsquo;s theory was.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us follow his own line of reasoning.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Albert pointed to the book that lay on the table between them.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In his Discourse on Method, Descartes raises the question of
the method the philosopher must use to solve a philosophical problem.
Science already had its new method...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So you said.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Descartes maintains that we cannot accept anything as being
true unless we can clearly and distinctly perceive it. To
achieve this can require the breaking down of a compound problem into
as many single factors as possible. Then we can take our point of
departure in the simplest idea of all. You could say that every
single thought must be weighed and measured, rather in the way
Galileo wanted everything to be measured and everything immeasurable
to be made measurable. Descartes believed that philosophy should
go from the simple to the complex. Only then would it be
possible to construct a new insight. And finally it would be
necessary to ensure by constant enumeration and control that
nothing was left out. Then, a philosophical conclusion would be
within reach.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It sounds almost like a math test.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Descartes was a mathematician; he is considered the
father of analytical geometry, and he made important
contributions to the science of algebra. Descartes wanted to use the
&lsquo;mathematical method&rsquo; even for philosophizing. He
set out to prove philosophical truths in the way one proves a
mathematical theorem. In other words, he wanted to use exactly the
same instrument that we use when we work with figures, namely,
reason, since only reason can give us certainty. It is far from
certain that we can rely on our senses. We have already noted
Descartes&rsquo;s affinity with Plato, who also observed that
mathematics and numerical ratio give us more certainty than the
evidence of our senses.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But can one solve philosophical problems that way?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We had better go back to Descartes&rsquo;s own reasoning.
His aim is to reach certainty about the nature of life, and he starts
by maintaining that at first one should doubt everything. He didn&rsquo;t
want to build on sand, you see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, because if the foundations give way, the whole house
collapses.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As you so neatly put it, my child. Now, Descartes did not
think it reasonable to doubt everything, but he thought it was
possible in principle to doubt everything. For one thing, it is by no
means certain that we advance our philosophical quest by reading
Plato or Aristotle. It may increase our knowledge of history but not
of the world. It was important for Descartes to rid himself of all
handed down, or received, learning before beginning his own
philosophical construction.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He wanted to clear all the rubble off the site before starting
to build his new house ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you. He wanted to use only fresh new materials in
order to be sure that his new thought construction would hold.
But Descartes&rsquo;s doubts went even deeper. We cannot even trust
what our senses tell us, he said. Maybe they are deceiving us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When we dream, we feel we are experiencing reality. What
separates our waking feelings from our dream feelings?</P>
<p>
&ldquo; &lsquo;When I consider this carefully, I find not a single
property which with certainty separates the waking state from the
dream,&rsquo; writes Descartes. And he goes on: &lsquo;How can you be
certain that your whole life is not a dream?&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Jeppe thought he had only been dreaming when he had slept in
the Baron&rsquo;s bed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And when he was lying in the Baron&rsquo;s bed, he thought his
life as a poor peasant was only a dream. So in the same way,
Descartes ends up doubting absolutely everything. Many philosophers
before him had reached the end of the road at that very point.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So they didn&rsquo;t get very far.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But Descartes tried to work forward from this zero point. He
doubted everything, and that was the only thing he was certain of.
But now something struck him: one thing had to be true, and that was
that he doubted. When he doubted, he had to be thinking, and because
he was thinking, it had to be certain that he was a thinking
being. Or, as he himself expressed it: Cogito, ergo sum.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Which means?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think, therefore I am.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised he realized that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Fair enough. But notice the intuitive certainty with which he
suddenly perceives himself as a thinking being. Perhaps you now
recall what Plato said, that what we grasp with our reason is more
real than what we grasp with our senses. That&rsquo;s the way it was
for Descartes. He perceived not only that he was a thinking /, he
realized at the same time that this thinking / was more real than the
material world which we perceive with our senses. And he went on. He
was by no means through with his philosophical quest.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What came next?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Descartes now asked himself if there was anything more he
could perceive with the same intuitive certainty.</P>
<p>
He came to the conclusion that in his mind he had a clear and
distinct idea of a perfect entity. This was an idea he had always
had, and it was thus self-evident to Descartes that such an idea
could not possibly have come from himself. The idea of a perfect
entity cannot have originated from one who was himself imperfect, he
claimed. Therefore the idea of a perfect entity must have originated
from that perfect entity itself, or in other words, from God. That
God exists was therefore just as self-evident for Descartes as that a
thinking being must exist.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now he was jumping to a conclusion. He was more cautious to
begin with.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Many people have called that his weak
spot. But you say &lsquo;conclusion.&rsquo; Actually it was not a
question of proof. Descartes only meant that we all possess the
idea of a perfect entity, and that inherent in that idea is the fact
that this perfect entity must exist. Because a perfect entity
wouldn&rsquo;t be perfect if it didn&rsquo;t exist. Neither would we
possess the idea of a perfect entity if there were no perfect entity.
For we are imperfect, so the idea of perfection cannot come from
us. According to Descartes, the idea of God is innate, it is
stamped on us from birth &lsquo;like the artisan&rsquo;s mark stamped
on his product.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but just because I possess the idea of a crocophant
doesn&rsquo;t mean that the crocophant exists.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Descartes would have said that it is not inherent in the
concept of a crocophant that it exists. On the other hand, it is
inherent in the concept of a perfect entity that such an entity
exists. According to Descartes, this is just as certain as it is
inherent in the idea of a circle that all points of the circle are
equidistant from the center. You cannot have a circle that does not
conform to this law. Nor can you have a perfect entity that lacks its
most important property, namely, existence.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an odd way of thinking.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is a decidedly rationalistic way of thinking. Descartes
believed like Socrates and Plato that there is a connection between
reason and being. The more self-evident a thing is to one&rsquo;s
reason, the more certain it is that it exists.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So far he has gotten to the fact that he is a thinking person
and that there exists a perfect entity.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and with this as his point of departure, he proceeds.
In the question of all the ideas we have about outer reality&mdash;for
example, the sun and the moon&mdash;there is the possibility that
they are fantasies. But outer reality also has certain
characteristics that we can perceive with our reason. These are the
mathematical properties, or, in other words, the kinds of things that
are measurable, such as length, breadth, and depth. Such
&lsquo;quantitative&rsquo; properties are just as clear and distinct
to my reason as the fact that I am a thinking being. &lsquo;Qualitative&rsquo;
properties such as color, smell, and taste, on the other hand,
are linked to our sense perception and as such do not describe outer
reality.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So nature is not a dream after all.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, and on that point Descartes once again draws upon our idea
of the perfect entity. When our reason recognizes something clearly
and distinctly&mdash;as is the case for the mathematical properties
of outer reality&mdash;it must necessarily be so. Because a perfect
God would not deceive us. Descartes claims &lsquo;God&rsquo;s
guarantee&rsquo; that whatever we perceive with our reason also
corresponds to reality.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, so now he&rsquo;s found out he&rsquo;s a thinking being,
God exists, and there is an outer reality.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but the outer reality is essentially different from the
reality of thought. Descartes now maintains that there are two
different forms of reality&mdash;or two &lsquo;substances.&rsquo; One
substance is thought, or the &lsquo;mind,&rsquo; the other is
extension, or matter. The mind is purely conscious, it takes up no
room in space and can therefore not be subdivided into smaller
parts. Matter, however, is purely extension, it takes up room in
space and can therefore always be subdivided into smaller and smaller
parts&mdash; but it has no consciousness. Descartes maintained that
both substances originate from God, because only God himself exists
independently of anything else. But although both thought and
extension come from God, the two substances have no contact with each
other. Thought is quite independent of matter, and conversely, the
material processes are quite independent of thought.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he divided God&rsquo;s creation into two.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Precisely. We say that Descartes is a dualist, which means
that he effects a sharp division between the reality of thought and
extended reality. For example, only man has a mind. Animals belong
completely to extended reality. Their living and moving are
accomplished mechanically. Descartes considered an animal to be
a kind of complicated automaton. As regards extended reality, he
takes a thoroughly mechanistic view&mdash;exactly like the
materialists.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I doubt very much that Hermes is a machine or an automaton.
Descartes couldn&rsquo;t have liked animals very much. And what about
us? Are we automatons as well?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We are and we aren&rsquo;t. Descartes came to the conclusion
that man is a dual creature that both thinks and takes up room in
space. Man has thus both a mind and an extended body. St. Augustine
and Thomas Aquinas had already said something similar, namely, that
man had a body like the animals and a soul like the angels. According
to Descartes, the human body is a perfect machine. But man also has a
mind which can operate quite independently of the body. The bodily
processes do not have the same freedom, they obey their own laws. But
what we think with our reason does not happen in the body&mdash;it
happens in the mind, which is completely independent of extended
reality. I should add, by the way, that Descartes did not reject the
possibility that animals could think. But if they have that faculty,
the same dualism between thought and extension must also apply to
them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We have talked about this before. If I decide to run after a
bus, the whole &lsquo;automaton&rsquo; goes into action. And if I
don&rsquo;t catch the bus, I start to cry.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Even Descartes could not deny that there is a constant
interaction between mind and body. As long as the mind is in the
body, he believed, it is linked to the brain through a special brain
organ which he called the pineal gland, where a constant interaction
takes place between &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; and &lsquo;matter.&rsquo;
Therefore the mind can constantly be affected by feelings and
passions that are related to bodily needs. But the mind can also
detach itself from such &lsquo;base&rsquo; impulses and operate
independently of the body. The aim is to get reason to assume
command. Because even if I have the worst pain in my stomach, the sum
of the angles in a triangle will still be 180 degrees. Thus
humans have the capacity to rise above bodily needs and behave
rationally. In this sense the mind is superior to the body. Our legs
can age and become weak, the back can become bowed and our teeth can
fall out&mdash;but two and two will go on being four as long as there
is reason left in us. Reason doesn&rsquo;t become bowed and weak. It
is the body that ages. For Descartes, the mind is essentially
thought. Baser passions and feelings such as desire and hate are more
closely linked to our bodily functions&mdash;and therefore to
extended reality.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get over the fact that Descartes compared the
human body to a machine or an automaton.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The comparison was based on the fact that people in his time
were deeply fascinated by machines and the workings of clocks, which
appeared to have the ability to function of their own accord. The
word &lsquo;automaton&rsquo; means precisely that&mdash;something
that moves of its own accord. It was obviously only an illusion that
they moved of their own accord. An astronomical clock, for instance,
is both constructed and wound up by human hands. Descartes made a
point of the fact that ingenious inventions of that kind were
actually assembled very simply from a relatively small number of
parts compared with the vast number of bones, muscles, nerves, veins,
and arteries that the human and the animal body consists of. Why
should God not be able to make an animal or a human body based on
mechanical laws?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nowadays there is a lot of talk about &lsquo;artificial
intelligence.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that is the automaton of our time. We have created
machines that can sometimes deceive us into believing that they
are intelligent. Machines like these would have terrified Descartes
out of his wits. He might have begun to doubt whether human reason
really was as free and independent as he had supposed. And there are
philosophers who believe that man&rsquo;s spiritual life is no more
free than the bodily processes. The human soul is naturally
infinitely more complex than any data program, but some people
think that in principle we are just as unfree as these data programs.
But look, Sophie&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you something.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto pointed to a large writing table at the other end of the
room. On it stood a small computer. He went over to it. Sophie
followed him.</P>
<p>
Alberto switched the computer on and soon the screen showed C: at the
top. He wrote &ldquo;Laila,&rdquo; explaining that this was an
advanced conversation program.</P>
<p>
A text soon appeared at the top of the screen:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hi, my name is Laila. Are you sitting comfortably?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie entered three letters:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she wrote although she had not yet sat down.
Alberto brought up a chair for her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; appeared on the screen.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sophie Amundsen,&rdquo; wrote Sophie, and the computer
answered:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;3 Clover Close. Nice to meet you, Sophie. Are you looking
forward to your fifteenth birthday?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie was startled. Alberto laid a hand on her shoulder and
said: &ldquo;I have only given her your name, your address, and your
date of birth. It&rsquo;s like when you are going to be introduced to
a new friend. It&rsquo;s nice to know a little about them
beforehand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; wrote Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, I hope you are not feeling bad, Sophie. You must try
to talk in whole sentences.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;m perfectly well. Can I ask you something?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am glad you are well. Go ahead and ask me something.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; Sophie wrote.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I was constructed in Atlanta on August 8, 1988, but I was
translated into Norwegian at the Norwegian Polytechnic on March
28, 1990.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;I said you must talk in whole sentences.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I only said gosh!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not understand slang. I have a vocabulary of over 100,000
words, but the nearest I can find to gosh is gospel.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That means the story of Jesus.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you a Christian, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As a rule not knowing is a step toward new knowledge.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Socrates would most likely have said the same. Or Descartes,
for that matter.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Socrates was a Greek philosopher who lived from 470 to 399
B.C. If you wish to know more, press F7. Descartes was a French
philosopher who lived from 1596 to 1650. If you wish to know more,
press F7.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, that will be quite enough. Can I ask you something
else?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am glad that this was enough. Go ahead and ask!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto laughed quietly. Sophie wrote:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Who is Hilde Moller Knag?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde Moller Knag lives in Lillesand and is exactly the same
age as Sophie Amundsen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how. I found her on the hard disc.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie felt a hand on her shoulder.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have fed the data program with the little information
we have about Hilde,&rdquo; said Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What else do you know about Hilde?&rdquo; wrote Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde&rsquo;s father is a UN Observer in Lebanon. He has the
rank of major and continually sends postcards to his daughter.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I want you to find him!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that. He is not on any of my files and I am
not coupled to any other data base.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I said find him!!!!!!!!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you angry, Sophie? So many exclamation marks are a sign of
violent feelings.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I want to talk to Hilde&rsquo;s father!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You have difficulty controlling yourself. If you wish to talk
about your childhood, press F9.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto laid his hand on Sophie&rsquo;s shoulder again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right. This is not a crystal ball. Laila is only a
data program.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; wrote Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As you wish, Sophie. Our acquaintance lasted only 13 minutes
and 52 seconds. I shall remember everything we have said. I shall now
end the program.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The letter C: once again showed up on the screen.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now we can sit down again,&rdquo; said Alberto.</P>
<p>
But Sophie had already pressed some other keys.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Knag,&rdquo; she wrote.</P>
<p>
Immediately the following message appeared on the screen:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Now it was Alberto who jumped.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; wrote Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Major Albert Knag at your service. I came straight from
Lebanon. What is your command?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This beats everything!&rdquo; breathed Alberto. &ldquo;The rat
has sneaked onto the hard disc.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He motioned for Sophie to move and sat down in front of the keyboard.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How did you manage to get into my PC?&rdquo; he wrote.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A mere bagatelle, dear colleague. I am exactly where I choose
to be.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You loathsome data virus!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, now! At the moment I am here as a birthday virus. May I
send a special greeting?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No thanks, we&rsquo;ve had enough of them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be quick: all in your honor, dear Hilde. Once
again, a very happy fifteenth birthday. Please excuse the
circumstances, but I wanted my birthday greetings to spring up around
you everywhere you go. Love from Dad, who is longing to give you a
great big hug.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Before Alberto could write again, the sign C: had once again appeared
on the screen.</P>
<p>
Alberto wrote &ldquo;dir knag*.*,&rdquo; which called up the
following information on the screen:</P>
<p>
knag.lib        147,643        06-15-90        12:47 
</P>
<p>
knag.lil        326,439       06-23-90       22:34</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Alberto wrote &ldquo;erase knag*.*&rdquo; and switched off the
computer.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&mdash;now I have erased him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s impossible to say where he&rsquo;ll turn up next time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He went on sitting there, staring at the screen. Then he added:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The worst of it all was the name. Albert Knag ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
For the first time Sophie was struck by the similarity between the
two names. Albert Knag and Alberto Knox. But Alberto was so incensed
that she dared not say a word. They went over and sat by the coffee
table again.</P>
<br /><h3>Spinoza</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;God is not a puppeteer&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
They sat silently for a long time. Then Sophie spoke, trying to get
Alberto&rsquo;s mind off what had happened.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Descartes must have been an odd kind of person. Did he become
famous?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto breathed deeply for a couple of seconds before
answering: &ldquo;He had a great deal of significance. Perhaps most
of all for another great philosopher, Ba-ruch Spinoza, who lived from
1632 to 1677.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to tell me about him?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was my intention. And we&rsquo;re not going to be stopped
by military provocations.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ears.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Spinoza belonged to the Jewish community of Amsterdam,
but he was excommunicated for heresy. Few philosophers in more recent
times have been so blasphemed and so persecuted for their ideas
as this man. It happened because he criticized the established
religion. He believed that Christianity and Judaism were only kept
alive by rigid dogma and outer ritual. He was the first to apply what
we call a historico-critical interpretation of the Bible.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Explanation, please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He denied that the Bible was inspired by God down to the last
letter. When we read the Bible, he said, we must continually bear in
mind the period it was written in. A &lsquo;critical&rsquo; reading,
such as the one he proposed, revealed a number of inconsistencies in
the texts. But beneath the surface of the Scriptures in the New
Testament is Jesus, who could well be called God&rsquo;s
mouthpiece. The teachings of Jesus therefore represented a
liberation from the orthodoxy of Judaism. Jesus preached a &lsquo;religion
of reason&rsquo; which valued love higher than all else. Spinoza
interpreted this as meaning both love of God and love of humanity.
Nevertheless, Christianity had also become set in its own rigid
dogmas and outer rituals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose these ideas were easy to swallow, either
for the church or the synagogue.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When things got really tough, Spinoza was even deserted
by his own family. They tried to disinherit him on the grounds of his
heresy. Paradoxically enough, few have spoken out more powerfully in
the cause of free speech and religious tolerance than Spinoza. The
opposition he was met with on all sides led him to pursue a
quiet and secluded life devoted entirely to philosophy. He earned a
meager living by polishing lenses, some of which have come into my
possession.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Very impressive!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There is almost something symbolic in the fact that he lived
by polishing lenses. A philosopher must help people to see life in a
new perspective. One of the pillars of Spinoza&rsquo;s philosophy was
indeed to see things from the perspective of eternity.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The perspective of eternity?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Sophie. Do you think you can imagine your own life in a
cosmic context? You&rsquo;ll have to try and imagine yourself and
your life here and now ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hm ... that&rsquo;s not so easy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Remind yourself that you are only living a minuscule part
of all nature&rsquo;s life. You are part of an enormous whole.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I see what you mean ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you manage to feel it as well? Can you perceive all of
nature at one time&mdash;the whole universe, in fact&mdash; at a
single glance?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I doubt it. Maybe I need some lenses.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean only the infinity of space. I mean the
eternity of time as well. Once upon a time, thirty thousand
years ago there lived a little boy in the Rhine valley. He was a
tiny part of nature, a tiny ripple on an endless sea. You too,
Sophie, you too are living a tiny part of nature&rsquo;s life. There
is no difference between you and that boy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Except that I&rsquo;m alive now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but that is precisely what I wanted you to try and
imagine. Who will you be in thirty thousand years?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was that the heresy?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not entirely ... Spinoza didn&rsquo;t only say that
everything is nature. He identified nature with God. He said God
is all, and all is in God.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he was a pantheist.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. To Spinoza, God did not create the world in
order to stand outside it. No, God is the world. Sometimes Spinoza
expresses it differently. He maintains that the world is in God.
In this, he is quoting St. Paul&rsquo;s speech to the Athenians on
the Areopagos hill: &lsquo;In him we live and move and have our
being.&rsquo; But let us pursue Spinoza&rsquo;s own reasoning. His
most important book was his Ethics Geometrically Demonstrated.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ethics&mdash;geometrically demonstrated?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It may sound a bit strange to us. In philosophy, ethics means
the study of moral conduct for living a good life. This is also what
we mean when we speak of the ethics of Socrates or Aristotle, for
example. It is only in our own time that ethics has more or less
become reduced to a set of rules for living without treading on other
people&rsquo;s toes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because thinking of yourself is supposed to be egoism?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Something like that, yes. When Spinoza uses the word ethics,
he means both the art of living and moral conduct.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But even so ... the art of living demonstrated
geometrically?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The geometrical method refers to the terminology he used for
his formulations. You may recall how Descartes wished to use
mathematical method for philosophical reflection. By this he
meant a form of philosophic reflection that was constructed from
strictly logical conclusions. Spinoza was part of the same
rationalistic tradition. He wanted his ethics to show that human
life is subject to the universal laws of nature. We must therefore
free ourselves from our feelings and our passions. Only then will we
find contentment and be happy, he believed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Surely we are not ruled exclusively by the laws of nature?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Spinoza is not an easy philosopher to grasp. Let&rsquo;s
take him bit by bit. You remember that Descartes believed that
reality consisted of two completely separate substances, namely
thought and extension.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How could I have forgotten it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The word &lsquo;substance&rsquo; can be interpreted as &lsquo;that
which something consists of,&rsquo; or that which something basically
is or can be reduced to. Descartes operated then with two of these
substances. Everything was either thought or extension.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;However, Spinoza rejected this split. He believed that there
was only one substance. Everything that exists can be reduced to one
single reality which he simply called Substance. At times he calls it
God or nature. Thus Spinoza does not have the dualistic view of
reality that Descartes had. We say he is a monist. That is, he
reduces nature and the condition of all things to one single
substance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They could hardly have disagreed more.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but the difference between Descartes and Spinoza is
not as deep-seated as many have often claimed. Descartes also pointed
out that only God exists independently. It&rsquo;s only when
Spinoza identifies God with nature&mdash;or God and
creation&mdash;that he distances himself a good way from both
Descartes and from the Jewish and Christian doctrines.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So then nature is God, and that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But when Spinoza uses the word &lsquo;nature,&rsquo; he
doesn&rsquo;t only mean extended nature. By Substance, God, or
nature, he means everything that exists, including all things
spiritual.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You mean both thought and extension.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You said it! According to Spinoza, we humans recognize
two of God&rsquo;s qualities or manifestations. Spinoza called these
qualities God&rsquo;s attributes, and these two attributes are
identical with Descartes&rsquo;s &lsquo;thought&rsquo; and
&lsquo;extension.&rsquo; God&mdash;or nature&mdash;manifests
itself either as thought or as extension. It may well be that God has
infinitely more attributes than &lsquo;thought&rsquo; and
&lsquo;extension,&rsquo; but these are the only two that are known to
man.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Fair enough, but what a complicated way of saying it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, one almost needs a hammer and chisel to get through
Spinoza&rsquo;s language. The reward is that in the end you dig out a
thought as crystal clear as a diamond.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can hardly wait!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Everything in nature, then, is either thought or extension.
The various phenomena we come across in everyday life, such as a
flower or a poem by Wordsworth, are different modes of the
attribute of thought or extension. A &lsquo;mode&rsquo; is the
particular manner which Substance, God, or nature assumes. A
flower is a mode of the attribute of extension, and a poem about the
same flower is a mode of the attribute of thought. But both are
basically the expression of Substance, God, or nature.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You could have fooled me!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not as complicated as he makes it sound.
Beneath his stringent formulation lies a wonderful realization
that is actually so simple that everyday language cannot accommodate
it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I prefer everyday language, if it&rsquo;s all the same
to you.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Right. Then I&rsquo;d better begin with you yourself. When you
get a pain in your stomach, what is it that has a pain?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like you just said. It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Fair enough. And when you later recollect that you once had a
pain in your stomach, what is it that thinks?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, too.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So you are a single person that has a stomachache one minute
and is in a thoughtful mood the next. Spinoza maintained that
all material things and things that happen around us are an
expression of God or nature. So it follows that all thoughts that we
think are also God&rsquo;s or nature&rsquo;s thoughts. For everything
is One. There is only one God, one nature, or one Substance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But listen, when I think something, I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s
doing the thinking. When I move, I&rsquo;m doing the moving. Why do
you have to mix God into it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I like your involvement. But who are you? You are Sophie
Amundsen, but you are also the expression of something infinitely
bigger. You can, if you wish, say that you are thinking or that you
are moving, but could you not also say that it is nature that is
thinking your thoughts, or that it is nature that is moving through
you? It&rsquo;s really just a question of which lenses you choose to
look through.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you saying I cannot decide for myself?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes and no. You may have the right to move your thumb any way
you choose. But your thumb can only move according to its nature. It
cannot jump off your hand and dance about the room. In the same way
you also have your place in the structure of existence, my dear. You
are Sophie, but you are also a finger of God&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So God decides everything I do?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Or nature, or the laws of nature. Spinoza believed that God&mdash;or
the laws of nature&mdash;is the inner cause of everything that
happens. He is not an outer cause, since God speaks through the laws
of nature and only through them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I can see the difference.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;God is not a puppeteer who pulls all the strings, controlling
everything that happens. A real puppet master controls the
puppets from outside and is therefore the &lsquo;outer cause&rsquo;
of the puppet&rsquo;s movements. But that is not the way God controls
the world. God controls the world through natural laws. So God&mdash;or
nature&mdash;is the &lsquo;inner cause&rsquo; of everything that
happens. This means that everything in the material world happens
through necessity. Spinoza had a determinist view of the
material, or natural, world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think you said something like that before.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably thinking of the Stoics. They also
claimed that everything happens out of necessity. That was why it was
important to meet every situation with &lsquo;stoicism.&rsquo; Man
should not get carried away by his feelings. Briefly, that was
also Spinoza&rsquo;s ethics.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see what you mean, but I still don&rsquo;t like the idea
that I don&rsquo;t decide for myself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s go back in time to the Stone Age boy who
lived thirty thousand years ago. When he grew up, he cast spears
after wild animals, loved a woman who became the mother of his
children, and quite certainly worshipped the tribal gods. Do you
really think he decided all that for himself?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Or think of a lion in Africa. Do you think it makes up its
mind to be a beast of prey? Is that why it attacks a limping
antelope? Could it instead have made up its mind to be a vegetarian?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, a lion obeys its nature.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You mean, the laws of nature. So do you, Sophie, because you
are also part of nature. You could of course protest, with the
support of Descartes, that a lion is an animal and not a free human
being with free mental faculties. But think of a newborn baby that
screams and yells. If it doesn&rsquo;t get milk it sucks its thumb.
Does that baby have a free will?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I guess not.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When does the child get its free will, then? At the age of
two, she runs around and points at everything in sight. At the age of
three she nags her mother, and at the age of four she suddenly gets
afraid of the dark. Where&rsquo;s the freedom, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When she is fifteen, she sits in front of a mirror
experimenting with makeup. Is this the moment when she makes her own
personal decisions and does what she likes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see what you&rsquo;re getting at.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She is Sophie Amundsen, certainly. But she also lives
according to the laws of nature. The point is that she doesn&rsquo;t
realize it because there are so many complex reasons for everything
she does.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I want to hear any more.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you must just answer a last question. Two equally old
trees are growing in a large garden. One of the trees grows in a
sunny spot and has plenty of good soil and water. The other tree
grows in poor soil in a dark spot. Which of the trees do you think is
bigger? And which of them bears more fruit?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Obviously the tree with the best conditions for growing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;According to Spinoza, this tree is free. It has its full
freedom to develop its inherent abilities. But if it is an apple tree
it will not have the ability to bear pears or plums. The same applies
to us humans. We can be hindered in our development and our
personal growth by political conditions, for instance. Outer
circumstances can constrain us. Only when we are free to develop our
innate abilities can we live as free beings. But we are just as much
determined by inner potential and outer opportunities as the Stone
Age boy on the Rhine, the lion in Africa, or the apple tree in the
garden.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, I give in, almost.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Spinoza emphasizes that there is only one being which is
totally and utterly &lsquo;its own cause&rsquo; and can act with
complete freedom. Only God or nature is the expression of such a
free and &lsquo;nonaccidental&rsquo; process. Man can strive for
freedom in order to live without outer constraint, but he will
never achieve &lsquo;free will.&rsquo; We do not control everything
that happens in our body&mdash;which is a mode of the attribute of
extension. Neither do we &lsquo;choose&rsquo; our thinking. Man
therefore does not have a &lsquo;free soul&rsquo;; it is more or less
imprisoned in a mechanical body.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is rather hard to understand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Spinoza said that it was our passions&mdash;such as ambition
and lust&mdash;which prevent us from achieving true happiness and
harmony, but that if we recognize that everything happens from
necessity, we can achieve an intuitive understanding of nature as a
whole. We can come to realize with crystal clarity that everything is
related, even that everything is One. The goal is to comprehend
everything that exists in an all-embracing perception. Only then
will we achieve true happiness and contentment. This was what Spinoza
called seeing everything &lsquo;sub specie aeternitatis.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Which means what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To see everything from the perspective of eternity. Wasn&rsquo;t
that where we started?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to be where we end, too. I must get going.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto got up and fetched a large fruit dish from the book shelves.
He set it on the coffee table.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you at least have a piece of fruit before you go?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie helped herself to a banana. Alberto took a green apple.</P>
<p>
She broke off the top of the banana and began to peel it.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something written here,&rdquo; she said
suddenly.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Here&mdash;inside the banana peel. It looks as if it was
written with an ink brush.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie leaned over and showed Alberto the banana. He read aloud:</P>
<p>
Here I am again, Hilde. I&rsquo;m everywhere. Happy birthday!</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Very funny,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He gets more crafty all the time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s impossible ... isn&rsquo;t it? Do you know if
they grow bananas in Lebanon?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto shook his head.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly not going to eat that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Leave it then. Someone who writes birthday greetings to
his daughter on the inside of an unpeeled banana must be mentally
disturbed. But he must also be quite ingenious.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, both.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So shall we establish here and now that Hilde has an ingenious
father? In other words, he&rsquo;s not so stupid.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been telling you. And it could
just as well be him that made you call me Hilde last time I came
here. Maybe he&rsquo;s the one putting all the words in our mouths.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing can be ruled out. But we should doubt everything.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For all we know, our entire life could be a dream.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s not jump to conclusions. There could be a
simpler explanation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well whatever, I have to hurry home. My mom is waiting for
me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto saw her to the door. As she left, he said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again, dear Hilde.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Then the door closed behind her.</P>
<br /><h3>LOCKE</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip; as hare and empty as a blackboard before the teacher
arrives&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie arrived home at eight-thirty. That was one and a half hours
after the agreement&mdash;which was not really an agreement. She had
simply skipped dinner and left a message for her mother that she
would be back not later than seven.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This has got to stop, Sophie. I had to call information
and ask if they had any record of anyone named Alberto in the Old
Town. They laughed at me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get away. I think we&rsquo;re just about to
make a breakthrough in a huge mystery.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you invite him to your party?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I forgot.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, now I insist on meeting him. Tomorrow at the latest.
It&rsquo;s not natural for a young girl to be meeting an older man
like this.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got no reason to be scared of Alberto. It may be
worse with Hilde&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Hilde?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The daughter of the man in Lebanon. He&rsquo;s really bad. He
may be controlling the whole world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t immediately introduce me to your Alberto,
I won&rsquo;t allow you to see him again. I won&rsquo;t feel easy
about him until I at least know what he looks like.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie had a brilliant idea and dashed up to her room.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you now?&rdquo; her mother called
after her.</P>
<p>
In a flash Sophie was back again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In a minute you&rsquo;ll see what he looks like. And then I
hope you&rsquo;ll let me be.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She waved the video cassette and went over to the VCR.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did he give you a video?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;From Athens...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Pictures of the Acropolis soon appeared on the screen. Her mother sat
dumbfounded as Alberto came forward and began to speak directly to
Sophie.</P>
<p>
Sophie now noticed something she had forgotten about. The Acropolis
was crowded with tourists milling about in their respective groups. A
small placard was being held up from the middle of one group. On it
was written HILDE ... Alberto continued his wandering on the
Acropolis. After a while he went down through the entrance and
climbed to the Areopagos hill where Paul had addressed the Athenians.
Then he went on to talk to Sophie from the square.</P>
<p>
Her mother sat commenting on the video in short utterances:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Incredible... is that Alberto? He mentioned the rabbit
again... But, yes, he&rsquo;s really talking to you, Sophie. I
didn&rsquo;t know Paul went to Athens ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The video was coming to the part where ancient Athens suddenly
rises from the ruins. At the last minute Sophie managed to stop the
tape. Now that she had shown her mother Alberto, there was no need to
introduce her to Plato as well.</P>
<p>
There was silence in the room.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you think of him? He&rsquo;s quite good-looking, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; teased Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a strange man he must be, having himself filmed in Athens
just so he could send it to a girl he hardly knows. When was he in
Athens?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a clue.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s something else ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;He looks very much like the major who lived in that little
hut in the woods.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well maybe it is him, Mom.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But nobody has seen him for over fifteen years.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He probably moved around a lot... to Athens, maybe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother shook her head. &ldquo;When I saw him sometime in the
seventies, he wasn&rsquo;t a day younger than this Alberto I just
saw. He had a foreign-sounding name...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Knox?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Could be, Sophie. Could be his name was Knox.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Or was it Knag?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t for the life of me remember ... Which Knox or
Knag are you talking about?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;One is Alberto, the other is Hilde&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all making me dizzy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is there any food in the house?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You can warm up the meatballs.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Exactly two weeks went by without Sophie hearing a word from Alberto.
She got another birthday card for Hilde, but although the actual day
was approaching, she did not receive a single birthday card herself.</P>
<p>
One afternoon she went to the Old Town and knocked on Alberto&rsquo;s
door. He was out, but there was a short note attached to his door. It
said:</P>
<p>
Happy birthday, Hilde! Now the great turning point is at hand. The
moment of truth, little one. Every time I think about it, I can&rsquo;t
stop laughing. It has naturally something to do with Berkeley, so
hold on to your hat.</P>
<p>
Sophie tore the note off the door and stuffed it into Alberto&rsquo;s
mailbox as she went out.</P>
<p>
Damn! Surely he&rsquo;d not gone back to Athens? How could he leave
her with so many questions unanswered?</P>
<p>
When she got home from school on June 14, Hermes was romping about in
the garden. Sophie ran toward him and he came prancing happily toward
her. She put her arms around him as if he were the one who could
solve all the riddles.</P>
<p>
Again she left a note for her mother, but this time she put Alberto&rsquo;s
address on it.</P>
<p>
As they made their way across town Sophie thought about tomorrow. Not
about her own birthday so much&mdash; that was not going to be
celebrated until Midsummer Eve anyway. But tomorrow was Hilde&rsquo;s
birthday too. Sophie was convinced something quite extraordinary
would happen. At least there would be an end to all those birthday
cards from Lebanon.</P>
<p>
When they had crossed Main Square and were making for the Old Town,
they passed by a park with a playground. Hermes stopped by a
bench as if he wanted Sophie to sit down.</P>
<p>
She did, and while she patted the dog&rsquo;s head she looked into
his eyes. Suddenly the dog started to shudder violently. He&rsquo;s
going to bark now, thought Sophie.</P>
<p>
Then his jaws began to vibrate, but Hermes neither growled nor
barked. He opened his mouth and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Happy birthday, Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie was speechless. Did the dog just talk to her? Impossible, she
must have imagined it because she was thinking of Hilde. But deep
down she was nevertheless convinced that Hermes had spoken, and in a
deep resonant bass voice.</P>
<p>
The next second everything was as before. Hermes gave a couple of
demonstrative barks&mdash;as if to cover up the fact that he had just
spoken with a human voice&mdash; and trotted on ahead toward
Alberto&rsquo;s place. As they were going inside Sophie looked up at
the sky. It had been fine weather all day but now heavy clouds were
beginning to gather in the distance.</P>
<p>
Alberto opened the door and Sophie said at once:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No civilities, please. You are a great idiot, and you know
it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The major taught Hermes to talk!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, so it has come to that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, imagine!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you three guesses.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I imagine he said something along the lines of Happy
Birthday!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Bingo.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto let Sophie in. He was dressed in yet another costume. It
wasn&rsquo;t all that different from last time, but today there were
hardly any braidings, bows, or lace.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not all,&rdquo; Sophie said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you find the note in the mailbox?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that. I threw it away at once.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if he laughs every time he thinks of
Berkeley. But what is so funny about that particular philosopher?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But today is the day you&rsquo;re going to talk about him,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, today is the day.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto made himself comfortable on the sofa. Then he said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Last time we sat here I told you about Descartes and Spinoza.
We agreed that they had one important thing in common, namely, that
they were both rationalists.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And a rationalist is someone who believes strongly in the
importance of reason.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, a rationalist believes in reason as the
primary source of knowledge, and he may also believe that man has
certain innate ideas that exist in the mind prior to all experience.
And the clearer such ideas may be, the more certain it is that they
correspond to reality. You recall how Descartes had a clear and
distinct idea of a &lsquo;perfect entity,&rsquo; on the basis of
which he concluded that God exists.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not especially forgetful.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Rationalist thinking of this kind was typical for philosophy
of the seventeenth century. It was also firmly rooted in the Middle
Ages, and we remember it from Plato and Socrates too. But in the
eighteenth century it was the object of an ever increasing in-depth
criticism. A number of philosophers held that we have absolutely
nothing in the mind that we have not experienced through the senses.
A view such as this is called empiricism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And you are going to talk about them today, these
empiricists?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to attempt to, yes. The most important
empiricists&mdash;or philosophers of experience&mdash;were Locke,
Berkeley, and Hume, and all three were British. The leading
rationalists in the seventeenth century were Descartes, who was
French; Spinoza, who was Dutch; and Leibniz, who was German. So we
usually make a distinction between British empiricism and Continental
rationalism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a lot of difficult words! Could you repeat the meaning of
empiricism?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;An empiricist will derive all knowledge of the world from what
the senses tell us. The classic formulation of an empirical approach
came from Aristotle. He said: &lsquo;There is nothing in the mind
except what was first in the senses.&rsquo; This view implied a
pointed criticism of Plato, who had held that man brought with him a
set of innate &lsquo;ideas&rsquo; from the world of ideas. Locke
repeats Aristotle&rsquo;s words, and when Locke uses them, they are
aimed at Descartes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing in the mind... except what was first in the
senses?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We have no innate ideas or conceptions about the world we are
brought into before we have seen it. If we do have a conception or an
idea that cannot be related to experienced facts, then it will be a
false conception. When we, for instance, use words like
&lsquo;God,&rdquo;eternity,&rsquo; or &lsquo;substance,&rsquo; reason
is being misused, because nobody has experienced God, eternity, or
what philosophers have called substance. So therefore many learned
dissertations could be written which in actual fact contain no
really new conceptions. An ingeniously contrived philosophical system
such as this may seem impressive, but it is pure fantasy.
Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century philosophers had inherited a
number of such learned dissertations. Now they had to be examined
under a microscope. They had to be purified of all hollow
notions. We might compare it with panning for gold. Most of what you
fish up is sand and clay, but in between you see the glint of a
particle of gold.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that particle of gold is real experience?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Or at least thoughts that can be related to experience. It
became a matter of great importance to the British empiricists to
scrutinize all human conceptions to see whether there was any basis
for them in actual experience. But let us take one philosopher
at a time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, shoot!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The first was the Englishman John Locke, who lived from 1632
to 1704. His main work was the Essay Concerning Human
Understanding, published in 1690. In it he tried to clarify two
questions. First, where we get our ideas from, and secondly, whether
we can rely on what our senses tell us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was some project!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take these questions one at a time. Locke&rsquo;s
claim is that all our thoughts and ideas issue from that which we
have taken in through the senses. Before we perceive anything, the
mind is a &lsquo;tabula rasa&rsquo;&mdash;or an empty slate.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You can skip the Latin.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Before we sense anything, then, the mind is as bare and empty
as a blackboard before the teacher arrives in the classroom. Locke
also compared the mind to an unfurnished room. But then we begin
to sense things. We see the world around us, we smell, taste, feel,
and hear. And nobody does this more intensely than infants. In this
way what Locke called simple ideas of sense arise. But the mind does
not just passively receive information from outside it. Some activity
happens in the mind as well. The single sense ideas are worked on by
thinking, reasoning, believing, and doubting, thus giving rise to
what he calls reflection. So he distinguished between &lsquo;sensation&rsquo;
and &lsquo;reflection.&rsquo; The mind is not merely a passive
receiver. It classifies and processes all sensations as they come
streaming in. And this is just where one must be on guard.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;On guard?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Locke emphasized that the only things we can perceive are
simple sensations. When I eat an apple, for example, I do not sense
the whole apple in one single sensation. In actual fact I receive a
whole series of simple sensations&mdash;such as that something
is green, smells fresh, and tastes juicy and sharp. Only after I have
eaten an apple many times do I think: Now I am eating an &lsquo;apple.&rsquo;
As Locke would say, we have formed a complex idea of an &lsquo;apple.&rsquo;
When we were infants, tasting an apple for the first time, we had no
such complex idea. But we saw something green, we tasted something
fresh and juicy, yummy ... It was a bit sour too. Little by little we
bundle many similar sensations together and form concepts like
&lsquo;apple,&rdquo;pear,&rdquo;orange.&rsquo; But in the final
analysis, all the material for our knowledge of the world comes to us
through sensations. Knowledge that cannot be traced back to a simple
sensation is therefore false knowledge and must consequently be
rejected.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;At any rate we can be sure that what we see, hear, smell, and
taste are the way we sense it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Both yes and no. And that brings us to the second question
Locke tried to answer. He had first answered the question of where we
get our ideas from. Now he asked whether the world really is the way
we perceive it. This is not so obvious, you see, Sophie. We mustn&rsquo;t
jump to conclusions. That is the only thing a real philosopher
must never do.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a word.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Locke distinguished between what he called &lsquo;primary&rsquo;
and &lsquo;secondary&rsquo; qualities. And in this he acknowledged
his debt to the great philosophers before him&mdash; including
Descartes.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;By primary qualities he meant extension, weight, motion and
number, and so on. When it is a question of qualities such as these,
we can be certain that the senses reproduce them objectively. But we
also sense other qualities in things. We say that something is sweet
or sour, green or red, hot or cold. Locke calls these secondary
qualities. Sensations like these&mdash;color, smell, taste, sound&mdash;do
not reproduce the real qualities that are inherent in the things
themselves. They reproduce only the effect of the outer reality on
our senses.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Everyone to his own taste, in other words.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. Everyone can agree on the primary qualities like size
and weight because they lie within the objects themselves. But the
secondary qualities like color and taste can vary from person to
person and from animal to animal, depending on the nature of the
individual&rsquo;s sensations.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When Joanna eats an orange, she gets a look on her face like
when other people eat a lemon. She can&rsquo;t take more than one
segment at a time. She says it tastes sour. I usually think the same
orange is nice and sweet.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And neither one of you is right or wrong. You are just
describing how the orange affects your senses. It&rsquo;s the same
with the sense of color. Maybe you don&rsquo;t like a certain shade
of red. But if Joanna buys a dress in that color it might be wise to
keep your opinion to yourself. You experience the color differently,
but it is neither pretty nor ugly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But everyone can agree that an orange is round.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, if you have a round orange, you can&rsquo;t &lsquo;think&rsquo;
it is square. You can &lsquo;think&rsquo; it is sweet or sour, but
you can&rsquo;t &lsquo;think&rsquo; it weighs eight kilos if it only
weighs two hundred grams. You can certainly &lsquo;believe&rsquo; it
weighs several kilos, but then you&rsquo;d be way off the mark. If
several people have to guess how much something weighs, there will
always be one of them who is more right than the others. The same
applies to number. Either there are 986 peas in the can or there are
not. The same with motion. Either the car is moving or it&rsquo;s
stationary.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I get it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So when it was a question of &lsquo;extended&rsquo; reality,
Locke agreed with Descartes that it does have certain qualities that
man is able to understand with his reason.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be so difficult to agree on that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Locke admitted what he called intuitive, or &lsquo;demonstrative,&rsquo;
knowledge in other areas too. For instance, he held that certain
ethical principles applied to everyone. In other words, he believed
in the idea of a natural right, and that was a rationalistic feature
of his thought. An equally rationalistic feature was that Locke
believed that it was inherent in human reason to be able to know that
God exists.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Maybe he was right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That God exists.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is possible, of course. But he did not let it rest on
faith. He believed that the idea of God was born of human
reason. That was a rationalistic feature. I should add that he spoke
out for intellectual liberty and tolerance. He was also
preoccupied with equality of the sexes, maintaining that the
subjugation of women to men was &lsquo;man-made.&rsquo; Therefore it
could be altered.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t disagree there.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Locke was one of the first philosophers in more recent
times to be interested in sexual roles. He had a great influence on
John Stuart Mill, who in turn had a key role in the struggle for
equality of the sexes. All in all, Locke was a forerunner of many
liberal ideas which later, during the period of the French
Enlightenment in the eighteenth century, came into full flower. It
was he who first advocated the principle of division of
powers...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that when the power of the state is divided
between different institutions?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you remember which institutions?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the legislative power, or elected
representatives. There&rsquo;s the judicial power, or law
courts, and then there&rsquo;s the executive power, that&rsquo;s the
government.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This division of power originated from the French
Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu. Locke had first and foremost
emphasized that the legislative and the executive power must be
separated if tyranny was to be avoided. He lived at the time of Louis
XIV, who had assembled all power in his own hands. &lsquo;I am the
State,&rsquo; he said. We say he was an &lsquo;absolute&rsquo; ruler.
Nowadays we would call Louis XIV&rsquo;s rule lawless and arbitrary.
Locke&rsquo;s view was that to ensure a legal State, the people&rsquo;s
representatives must make the laws and the king or the government
must apply them.&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>Hume</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;commit it then to the flames&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Alberto sat staring down at the table. He finally turned and looked
out of the window.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clouding over,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s muggy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to talk about Berkeley now?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He was the next of the three British empiricists. But as he is
in a category of his own in many ways, we will first concentrate on
David Hume, who lived from 1711 to 1776. He stands out as the most
important of the empiricists. He is also significant as the person
who set the great philosopher Immanuel Kant on the road to his
philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it matter to you that I&rsquo;m more interested
in Berkeley&rsquo;s philosophy?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s of no importance. Hume grew up near Edinburgh
in Scotland. His family wanted him to take up law but he felt &lsquo;an
insurmountable resistance to everything but philosophy and
learning.&rsquo; He lived in the Age of Enlightenment at the same
time as great French thinkers like Voltaire and Rousseau, and he
traveled widely in Europe before returning to settle down in
Edinburgh toward the end of his life. His main work, A Treatise of
Human Nature, was published when Hume was twenty-eight years old, but
he claimed that he got the idea for the book when he was only
fifteen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see I don&rsquo;t have any time to waste.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;You have already begun.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But if I were going to formulate my own philosophy, it
would be quite different from anything I&rsquo;ve heard up to now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is there anything in particular that&rsquo;s missing?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, to start with, all the philosophers you have talked
about are men. And men seem to live in a world of their own. I am
more interested in the real world, where there are flowers and
animals and children that are born and grow up. Your philosophers are
always talking about &lsquo;man&rsquo; and &lsquo;humans,&rsquo; and
now here&rsquo;s another treatise on &lsquo;human nature.&rsquo;
It&rsquo;s as if this &lsquo;human&rsquo; is a middle-aged man. I
mean, life begins with pregnancy and birth, and I&rsquo;ve heard
nothing about diapers or crying babies so far. And hardly anything
about love and friendship.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are right, of course. But Hume was a philosopher who
thought in a different way. More than any other philosopher, he took
the everyday world as his starting point. I even think Hume had a
strong feeling for the way children&mdash;the new citizens of the
world&mdash; experienced life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better listen then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As an empiricist, Hume took it upon himself to clean up all
the woolly concepts and thought constructions that these male
philosophers had invented. There were piles of old wreckage, both
written and spoken, from the Middle Ages and the rationalist
philosophy of the seventeenth century. Hume proposed the return
to our spontaneous experience of the world. No philosopher &lsquo;will
ever be able to take us behind the daily experiences or give us rules
of conduct that are different from those we get through reflections
on everyday life,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sounds promising so far. Can you give any examples?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In the time of Hume there was a widespread belief in angels.
That is, human figures with wings. Have you ever seen such a
creature, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you have seen a human figure?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Dumb question.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;You have also seen wings?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course, but not on a human figure.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So, according to Hume, an &lsquo;angel&rsquo; is a complex
idea. It consists of two different experiences which are not in fact
related, but which nevertheless are associated in man&rsquo;s
imagination. In other words, it is a false idea which must be
immediately rejected. We must tidy up all our thoughts and ideas, as
well as our book collections, in the same way. For as Hume put
it: If we take in our hands any volume ... let us ask, &lsquo;Does it
contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?&rsquo;
No. &lsquo;Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning
matter of fact and existence?&rsquo; No. Commit it then to the
flames, for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was drastic.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But the world still exists. More fresh and sharply outlined
than ever. Hume wanted to know how a child experiences the world.
Didn&rsquo;t you say that many of the philosophers you have heard
about lived in their own world, and that you were more interested in
the real world?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume could have said the same thing. But let us follow his
train of thought more closely.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume begins by establishing that man has two different
types of perceptions, namely impressions and ideas. By &lsquo;impressions&rsquo;
he means the immediate sensation of external reality. By &lsquo;ideas&rsquo;
he means the recollection of such impressions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Could you give me an example?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you burn yourself on a hot oven, you get an immediate
&lsquo;impression.&rsquo; Afterward you can recollect that you burned
yourself. That impression insofar as it is recalled is what Hume
calls an &lsquo;idea.&rsquo; The difference is that an impression is
stronger and livelier than your reflective memory of that
impression. You could say that the sensation is the original and that
the idea, or reflection, is only a pale imitation. It is the
impression which is the direct cause of the idea stored in the mind.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;I follow you&mdash;so far.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume emphasizes further that both an impression and an idea
can be either simple or complex. You remember we talked about an
apple in connection with Locke. The direct experience of an apple is
an example of a complex impression.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorry to interrupt, but is this terribly important?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Important? How can you ask? Even though philosophers may
have been preoccupied with a number of pseudoproblems, you mustn&rsquo;t
give up now over the construction of an argument. Hume would
probably agree with Descartes that it is essential to construct a
thought process right from the ground.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, okay.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume&rsquo;s point is that we sometimes form complex ideas for
which there is no corresponding object in the physical world. We&rsquo;ve
already talked about angels. Previously we referred to
crocophants. Another example is Pegasus, a winged horse. In all these
cases we have to admit that the mind has done a good job of cutting
out and pasting together all on its own. Each element was once
sensed, and entered the theater of the mind in the form of a real
&lsquo;impression.&rsquo; Nothing is ever actually invented by
the mind. The mind puts things together and constructs false &lsquo;ideas.&rsquo;
&ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see. That is important.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All right, then. Hume wanted to investigate every single idea
to see whether it was compounded in a way that does not correspond to
reality. He asked: From which impression does this idea originate?
First of all he had to find out which &lsquo;single ideas&rsquo; went
into the making of a complex idea. This would provide him with a
critical method by which to analyze our ideas, and thus enable him to
tidy up our thoughts and notions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you have an example or two?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In Hume&rsquo;s day, there were a lot of people who had very
clear ideas of &lsquo;heaven&rsquo; or the &lsquo;New Jerusalem.&rsquo;
You remember how Descartes indicated that &lsquo;clear and distinct&rsquo;
ideas in themselves could be a guarantee that they corresponded to
something that really existed?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I said I was not especially forgetful.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;We soon realize that our idea of &lsquo;heaven&rsquo; is
compounded of a great many elements. Heaven is made up of
&lsquo;pearly gates,&rdquo;streets of gold,&rdquo;angels&rsquo; by
the score and so on and so forth. And still we have not broken
everything down into single elements, for pearly gates, streets of
gold, and angels are all complex ideas in themselves. Only when
we recognize that our idea of heaven consists of single notions such
as &lsquo;pearl,&rdquo;gate,&rdquo;street,&rdquo;gold,&rdquo;white-robed
figure,&rsquo; and &lsquo;wings&rsquo; can we ask ourselves if
we ever really had any such &lsquo;simple impressions.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We did. But we cut out and pasted all these &lsquo;simple
impressions&rsquo; into one idea.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we did. Because if there is something
we humans do when we visualize, it&rsquo;s use scissors and paste.
But Hume emphasizes that all the elements we put together in our
ideas must at some time have entered the mind in the form of &lsquo;simple
impressions.&rsquo; A person who has never seen gold will never
be able to visualize streets of gold.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He was very clever. What about Descartes having a clear and
distinct idea of God?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume had an answer to that too. Let&rsquo;s say we imagine
God as an infinitely &lsquo;intelligent, wise, and good being.&rsquo;
We have thus a &lsquo;complex idea&rsquo; that consists of something
infinitely intelligent, something infinitely wise, and something
infinitely good. If we had never known intelligence, wisdom, and
goodness, we would never have such an idea of God. Our idea of God
might also be that he is a &lsquo;severe but just Father&rsquo;&mdash;that
is to say, a concept made up of &lsquo;severity&rsquo;,&rsquo;justice,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;father.&rsquo; Many critics of religion since Hume
have claimed that such ideas of God can be associated with how we
experienced our own father when we were little. It was said that the
idea of a father led to the idea of a &lsquo;heavenly father.&rsquo;
&ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s true, but I have never accepted that God
had to be a man. Sometimes my mother calls God &lsquo;Godiva,&rsquo;
just to even things up.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Anyway, Hume opposed all thoughts and ideas that could not be
traced back to corresponding sense perceptions. He said he wanted to
&lsquo;dismiss all this meaningless nonsense which long has dominated
metaphysical thought and brought it into disrepute.&rsquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But even in everyday life we use complex ideas without
stopping to wonder whether they are valid. For example, take the
question of T&mdash;or the ego. This was the very basis of
Descartes&rsquo;s philosophy. It was the one clear and distinct
perception that the whole of his philosophy was built on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope Hume didn&rsquo;t try to deny that I am me. He&rsquo;d
be talking off the top of his head.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sophie, if there is one thing I want this course to teach you,
it&rsquo;s not to jump to conclusions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorry. Go on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, why don&rsquo;t you use Hume&rsquo;s method and analyze
what you perceive as your &lsquo;ego.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;First I&rsquo;d have to figure out whether the ego is a single
or a complex idea.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And what conclusion do you come to?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I really have to admit that I feel quite complex. I&rsquo;m
very volatile, for instance. And I have trouble making up my mind
about things. And I can both like and dislike the same people.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In other words, the &lsquo;ego concept&rsquo; is a &lsquo;complex
idea.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay. So now I guess I must figure out if I have had a
corresponding &lsquo;complex impression&rsquo; of my own ego. And I
guess I have. I always had, actually.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does that worry you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very changeable. I&rsquo;m not the same today as I
was when I was four years old. My temperament and how I see myself
alter from one minute to the next. I can suddenly feel like I am a
&lsquo;new person.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So the feeling of having an unalterable ego is a false
perception. The perception of the ego is in reality a long chain of
simple impressions that you have never experienced
simultaneously. It is &lsquo;nothing but a bundle or collection of
different perceptions, which succeed one another with an
inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and
movement,&rsquo; as Hume expressed it. The mind is &lsquo;a kind of
theater, where several perceptions successively make their
appearance; pass, re-pass, slide away, and mingle in an infinite
variety of postures and situations.&rsquo; Hume pointed out that we
have no underlying &lsquo;personal identity&rsquo; beneath or
behind these perceptions and feelings which come and go. It is
just like the images on a movie screen. They change so rapidly we do
not register that the film is made up of single pictures. In reality
the pictures are not connected. The film is a collection of
instants.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I give in.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does that mean you give up the idea of having an unalterable
ego?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I guess it does.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A moment ago you believed the opposite. I should add that
Hume&rsquo;s analysis of the human mind and his rejection of the
unalterable ego was put forward almost 2,500 years earlier on the
other side of the world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Who by?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;By Buddha. It&rsquo;s almost uncanny how similarly the two
formulate their ideas. Buddha saw life as an unbroken succession
of mental and physical processes which keep people in a continual
state of change. The infant is not the same as the adult; I am not
the same today as I was yesterday. There is nothing of which I can
say &lsquo;this is mine,&rsquo; said Buddha, and nothing of which I
can say &lsquo;this is me.&rsquo; There is thus no T or unalterable
ego.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that was typically Hume.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In continuation of the idea of an unalterable ego, many
rationalists had taken it for granted that man had an eternal soul.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that a false perception too?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;According to Hume and Buddha, yes. Do you know what Buddha
said to his followers just before he died?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, how could I?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo; &lsquo;Decay is inherent in all compound things. Work out
your own salvation with diligence.&rsquo; Hume could have said the
same thing. Or Democritus, for that matter. We know at all events
that Hume rejected any attempt to prove the immortality of the soul
or the existence of God. That does not mean that he ruled out either
one, but to prove religious faith by human reason was rationalistic
claptrap, he thought. Hume was not a Christian, neither was he a
confirmed atheist. He was what we call an agnostic.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;An agnostic is someone who holds that the existence of God or
a god can neither be proved nor disproved. When Hume was dying a
friend asked him if he believed in life after death. He is said to
have answered:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is also possible that a knob of coal placed upon the fire
will not burn.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The answer was typical of his unconditional open-mindedness.
He only accepted what he had perceived through his senses. He held
all other possibilities open. He rejected neither faith in
Christianity nor faith in miracles. But both were matters of
faith and not of knowledge or reason. You might say that with
Hume&rsquo;s philosophy, the final link between faith and knowledge
was broken.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You say he didn&rsquo;t deny that miracles can happen?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t mean that he believed in them, more the
opposite. He made a point of the fact that people seemed to have a
powerful need of what we today would call &lsquo;supernatural&rsquo;
happenings. The thing is that all the miracles you hear of have
always happened in some far distant place or a long, long time ago.
Actually, Hume only rejected miracles because he had never
experienced any. But he had not experienced that they couldn&rsquo;t
happen either.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to explain that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;According to Hume, a miracle is against the laws of nature.
But it is meaningless to allege that we have experienced the
laws of nature. We experience that a stone falls to the ground when
we let go of it, and if it didn&rsquo;t fall&mdash;well, then we
experienced that.&rsquo;1&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I would say that was a miracle&mdash;or something
supernatural.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So you believe there are two natures&mdash;a &lsquo;natural&rsquo;
and a &lsquo;supernatural.&rsquo; Aren&rsquo;t you on the way back to
the rationalistic claptrap?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe, but I still think the stone will fall to the ground
every time I let go.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re being horrible.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not horrible, Sophie. It&rsquo;s never wrong for a
philosopher to ask questions. We may be getting to the crux of
Hume&rsquo;s philosophy. Tell me how you can be so certain that
the stone will always fall to the earth.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it happen so many times that I&rsquo;m
absolutely certain.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume would say that you have experienced a stone falling to
the ground many times. But you have never experienced that it will
always fall. It is usual to say that the stone falls to the ground
because of the law of gravitation. But we have never experienced
such a law. We have only experienced that things fall.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the same thing?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not completely. You say you believe the stone will fall to the
ground because you have seen it happen so many times. That&rsquo;s
exactly Hume&rsquo;s point. You are so used to the one thing
following the other that you expect the same to happen every time you
let go of a stone. This is the way the concept of what we like to
call &lsquo;the unbreakable laws of nature&rsquo; arises.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did he really mean it was possible that a stone would not
fall?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He was probably just as convinced as you that it would fall
every time he tried it. But he pointed out that he had not
experienced why it happens.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re far away from babies and flowers again!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, on the contrary. You are welcome to take children as
Hume&rsquo;s verification. Who do you think would be more surprised
if the stone floated above the ground for an hour or two&mdash;you or
a one-year-old child?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I guess I would.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because I would know better than the child how unnatural it
was.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And why wouldn&rsquo;t the child think it was unnatural?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because it hasn&rsquo;t yet learned how nature behaves.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Or perhaps because nature hasn&rsquo;t yet become a habit?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see where you&rsquo;re coming from. Hume wanted people
to sharpen their awareness.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So now do the following exercise: let&rsquo;s say you and a
small child go to a magic show, where things are made to float in the
air. Which of you would have the most fun?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I probably would.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And why would that be?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because I would know how impossible it all is.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So... for the child it&rsquo;s no fun to see the laws of
nature being defied before it has learned what they are.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And we are still at the crux of Hume&rsquo;s philosophy of
experience. He would have added that the child has not yet become a
slave of the expectations of habit; he is thus the more open-minded
of you two. I wonder if the child is not also the greater
philosopher? He comes utterly without preconceived opinions. And
that, my dear Sophie, is the philosopher&rsquo;s most distinguishing
virtue. The child perceives the world as it is, without putting
more into things than he experiences.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Every time I feel prejudice I get a bad feeling.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When Hume discusses the force of habit, he concentrates
on &lsquo;the law of causation.&rsquo; This law establishes that
everything that happens must have a cause. Hume used two billiard
balls for his example. If you roll a black billiard ball against a
white one that is at rest, what will the white one do?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If the black ball hits the white one, the white one will start
to move.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see, and why will it do that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because it was hit by the black one.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So we usually say that the impact of the black ball is the
cause of the white ball&rsquo;s starting to move. But remember now,
we can only talk of what we have actually experienced.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have actually experienced it lots of times. Joanna has a
pool table in her basement.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume would say the only thing you have experienced is that the
white ball begins to roll across the table. You have not experienced
the actual cause of it beginning to roll. You have experienced
that one event comes after the other, but you have not experienced
that the other event happens because o/the first one.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that splitting hairs?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s very central. Hume emphasized that the
expectation of one thing following another does not lie in the
things themselves, but in our mind. And expectation, as we have seen,
is associated with habit. Going back to the child again, it would not
have stared in amazement if when one billiard ball struck the other,
both had remained perfectly motionless. When we speak of the
&lsquo;laws of nature&rsquo; or of &lsquo;cause and effect,&rsquo; we
are actually speaking of what we expect, rather than what is
&lsquo;reasonable.&rsquo; The laws of nature are neither
reasonable nor unreasonable, they simply are. The expectation that
the white billiard ball will move when it is struck by the black
billiard ball is therefore not innate. We are not born with a set of
expectations as to what the world is like or how things in the world
behave. The world is like it is, and it&rsquo;s something we get to
know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to feel as if we&rsquo;re getting off the
track again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not if our expectations cause us to jump to conclusions.
Hume did not deny the existence of unbreakable &lsquo;natural laws,&rsquo;
but he held that because we are not in a position to experience the
natural laws themselves, we can easily come to the wrong
conclusions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, because I have seen a whole herd of black horses doesn&rsquo;t
mean that all horses are black.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And although I have seen nothing but black crows in my life,
it doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s no such thing as a white
crow. Both for a philosopher and for a scientist it can be important
not to reject the possibility of finding a white crow. You might
almost say that hunting for &lsquo;the white crow&rsquo; is science&rsquo;s
principal task.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In the question of cause and effect, there can be many people
who imagine that lightning is the cause of thunder because the
thunder comes after the lightning. The example is really not so
different from the one with the billiard balls. But is lightning the
cause of thunder?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not really, because actually they both happen at the same
time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Both thunder and lightning are due to an electric discharge.
So in reality a third factor causes them both.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;An empiricist of our own century, Bertrand Russell, has
provided a more grotesque example. A chicken which experiences every
day that it gets fed when the farmer&rsquo;s wife comes over to the
chicken run will finally come to the conclusion that there is a
causal link between the approach of the farmer&rsquo;s wife and
feed being put into its bowl.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But one day the chicken doesn&rsquo;t get its food?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, one day the farmer&rsquo;s wife comes over and wrings the
chicken&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yuck, how disgusting!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The fact that one thing follows after another thus does not
necessarily mean there is a causal link. One of the main concerns of
philosophy is to warn people against jumping to conclusions. It can
in fact lead to many different forms of superstition.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You see a black cat cross the street. Later that day you fall
and break your arm. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean there is any causal
link between the two incidents. In science, it is especially
important not to jump to conclusions. For instance, the fact that a
lot of people get well after taking a particular drug doesn&rsquo;t
mean it was the drug that cured them. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s
important to have a large control group of patients who think they
are also being given this same medicine, but who are in fact only
being given flour and water. If these patients also get well, there
has to be a third factor&mdash;such as the belief that the medicine
works, and has cured them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m beginning to see what empiricism is.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume also rebelled against rationalist thought in the area of
ethics. The rationalists had always held that the ability to
distinguish between right and wrong is inherent in human reason. We
have come across this idea of a so-called natural right in many
philosophers from Socrates to Locke. But according to Hume, it
is not reason that determines what we say and do.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is our sentiments. If you decide to help someone in need,
you do so because of your feelings, not your reason.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What if I can&rsquo;t be bothered to help?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That, too, would be a matter of feelings. It is neither
reasonable nor unreasonable not to help someone in need, but it could
be unkind.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But there must be a limit somewhere. Everyone knows it&rsquo;s
wrong to kill.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;According to Hume, everybody has a feeling for other people&rsquo;s
welfare. So we all have a capacity for compassion. But it has nothing
to do with reason.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I agree.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not always so unwise to get rid of another person,
Sophie. If you wish to achieve something or other, it can actually be
quite a good idea.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hey, wait a minute! I protest!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe you can try and explain why one shouldn&rsquo;t kill a
troublesome person.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;That person wants to live too. Therefore you ought not
to kill them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was that a logical reason?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What you did was to draw a conclusion from a descriptive
sentence&mdash;That person wants to live too&rsquo;&mdash;to what we
call a normative sentence: &lsquo;Therefore you ought not to kill
them.&rsquo; From the point of view of reason this is nonsense. You
might just as well say &lsquo;There are lots of people who cheat on
their taxes, therefore I ought to cheat on my taxes too.&rsquo; Hume
said you can never draw conclusions from is sentences to ought
sentences. Nevertheless it is exceedingly common, not least in
newspaper articles, political party programs, and speeches.
Would you like some examples?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo; &lsquo;More and more people want to travel by air. Therefore
more airports ought to be built.&rsquo; Do you think the conclusion
holds up?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s nonsense. We have to think of the environment.
I think we ought to build more railroads instead.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Or they say: The development of new oilfields will raise the
population&rsquo;s living standards by ten percent. Therefore we
ought to develop new oilfields as rapidly as possible.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Definitely not. We have to think of the environment again. And
anyway, the standard of living in Norway is high enough.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sometimes it is said that &lsquo;this law has been passed by
the Senate, therefore all citizens in this country ought to abide by
it.&rsquo; But frequently it goes against people&rsquo;s deepest
convictions to abide by such conventions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I understand that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So we have established that we cannot use reason as a
yardstick for how we ought to act. Acting responsibly is not a
matter of strengthening our reason but of deepening our feelings for
the welfare of others. &ldquo;Tis not contrary to reason to prefer
the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger,&rsquo;
said Hume.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hair-raising assertion.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s maybe even more hair-raising if you shuffle the
cards. You know that the Nazis murdered millions of Jews. Would you
say that there was something wrong with the Nazis&rsquo; reason, or
would you say there was something wrong with their emotional life?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There was definitely something wrong with their feelings.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Many of them were exceedingly clear-headed. It is not unusual
to find ice-cold calculation behind the most callous decisions. Many
of the Nazis were convicted after the war, but they were not
convicted for being &lsquo;unreasonable.&rsquo; They were
convicted for being gruesome murderers. It can happen that people who
are not of sound mind can be acquitted of their crimes. We say that
they were &lsquo;not accountable for their actions.&rsquo; Nobody has
ever been acquitted of a crime they committed for being unfeeling.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I should hope not.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But we need not stick to the most grotesque examples. If
a flood disaster renders millions of people homeless, it is our
feelings that determine whether we come to their aid. If we are
callous, and leave the whole thing to &lsquo;cold reason,&rsquo; we
might think it was actually quite in order that millions of people
die in a world that is threatened by overpopulation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It makes me mad that you can even think that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And notice it&rsquo;s not your reason that gets mad.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, I got it.&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>Berkeley</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;like a giddy planet round a burning sun&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Alberto walked over to the window facing the town. Sophie followed
him. While they stood looking out at the old houses, a small plane
flew in over the rooftops. Fixed to its tail was a long banner which
Sophie guessed would be advertising some product or local event, a
rock concert perhaps. But as it approached and turned, she saw quite
a different message: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HILDE!</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Gate-crasher,&rdquo; was Alberto&rsquo;s only comment.</P>
<p>
Heavy black clouds from the hills to the south were now beginning to
gather over the town. The little plane disappeared into the grayness.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s going to be a storm,&rdquo;
said Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll take the bus home.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I only hope the major isn&rsquo;t behind this, too.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not God Almighty, is he?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto did not reply. He walked across the room and sat down again
by the coffee table.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We have to talk about Berkeley,&rdquo; he said after a while.</P>
<p>
Sophie had already resumed her place. She caught herself biting her
nails.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;George Berkeley was an Irish bishop who lived from 1685 to
1753,&rdquo; Alberto began. There was a long silence.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Berkeley was an Irish bishop ...&rdquo; Sophie prompted.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But he was a philosopher as well...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He felt that current philosophies and science were a threat to
the Christian way of life, that the all-pervading materialism, not
least, represented a threat to the Christian faith in God as
creator and preserver of all nature.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He did?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet Berkeley was the most consistent of the empiricists.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He believed we cannot know any more of the world than we can
perceive through the senses?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;More than that. Berkeley claimed that worldly things are
indeed as we perceive them, but they are not &lsquo;things.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to explain that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You remember that Locke pointed out that we cannot make
statements about the &lsquo;secondary qualities&rsquo; of things. We
cannot say an apple is green and sour. We can only say we perceive it
as being so. But Locke also said that the &lsquo;primary qualities&rsquo;
like density, gravity, and weight really do belong to the external
reality around us. External reality has, in fact, a material
substance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember that, and I think Locke&rsquo;s division of things
was important.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Sophie, if only that were all.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Goon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Locke believed&mdash;just like Descartes and Spinoza&mdash;
that the material world is a reality.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is just what Berkeley questioned, and he did so by the
logic of empiricism. He said the only things that exist are those we
perceive. But we do not perceive &lsquo;material&rsquo; or
&lsquo;matter.&rsquo; We do not perceive things as tangible objects.
To assume that what we perceive has its own underlying &lsquo;substance&rsquo;
is jumping to conclusions. We have absolutely no experience on which
to base such a claim.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How stupid. Look!&rdquo; Sophie thumped her fist hard on the
table. &ldquo;Ouch,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that prove
that this table is really a table, both of material and matter?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How did you feel it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I felt something hard.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;You had a sensation of something hard, but you didn&rsquo;t
feel the actual matter in the table. In the same way, you can dream
you are hitting something hard, but there isn&rsquo;t anything hard
in a dream, is there?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not in a dream.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A person can also be hypnotized into &lsquo;feeling&rsquo;
things like warmth and cold, a caress or a punch.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But if the table wasn&rsquo;t really hard, why did I feel it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Berkeley believed in a &lsquo;spirit.&rsquo; He thought all
our ideas have a cause beyond our consciousness, but that this cause
is not of a material nature. It is spiritual.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie had started biting her nails again.</P>
<p>
Alberto continued: &ldquo;According to Berkeley, my own soul can be
the cause of my own ideas&mdash;just as when I dream&mdash;but only
another will or spirit can be the cause of the ideas that make up the
&lsquo;corporeal&rsquo; world. Everything is due to that spirit
which is the cause of &lsquo;everything in everything&rsquo; and
which &lsquo;all things consist in,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; was he talking about?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Berkeley was of course thinking of God. He said that &lsquo;we
can moreover claim that the existence of God is far more clearly
perceived than the existence of man.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it not even certain that we exist?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and no. Everything we see and feel is &lsquo;an effect of
God&rsquo;s power,&rsquo; said Berkeley. For God is &lsquo;intimately
present in our consciousness, causing to exist for us the profusion
of ideas and perceptions that we are constantly subject to.&rsquo;
The whole world around us and our whole life exist in God. He is the
one cause of everything that exists. We exist only in the mind of
God.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am amazed, to put it mildly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So &lsquo;to be or not to be&rsquo; is not the whole question.
The question is also who we are. Are we really human beings of flesh
and blood? Does our world consist of real things&mdash;or are we
encircled by the mind?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie continued to bite her nails.</P>
<p>
Alberto went on: &ldquo;Material reality was not the only thing
Berkeley was questioning. He was also questioning whether &lsquo;time&rsquo;
and &lsquo;space&rsquo; had any absolute or independent existence.
Our own perception of time and space can also be merely figments of
the mind. A week or two for us need not be a week or two for God ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You said that for Berkeley this spirit that everything exists
in is the Christian God.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I suppose I did. But for us ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Us?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For us&mdash;for you and me&mdash;this &lsquo;will or spirit&rsquo;
that is the &lsquo;cause of everything in everything&rsquo; could be
Hilde&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie&rsquo;s eyes opened wide with incredulity. Yet at the same
time a realization began to dawn on her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that what you think?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I cannot see any other possibility. That is perhaps the only
feasible explanation for everything that has happened to us. All
those postcards and signs that have turned up here and there...
Hermes beginning to talk ... my own involuntary slips of the tongue.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Imagine my calling you Sophie, Hilde! I knew all the time that
your name wasn&rsquo;t Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What are you saying? Now you are definitely confused.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my mind is going round and round, my child. Like a giddy
planet round a burning sun.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that sun is Hilde&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You could say so.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you saying he&rsquo;s been a kind of God for us?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To be perfectly candid, yes. He should be ashamed of himself!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What about Hilde herself?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She is an angel, Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;An angel?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde is the one this &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; turns to.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you saying that Albert Knag tells Hilde about us?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Or writes about us. For we cannot perceive the matter
itself that our reality is made of, that much we have learned. We
cannot know whether our external reality is made of sound waves or of
paper and writing. According to Berkeley, all we can know is that we
are spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;And Hilde is an angel...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde is an angel, yes. Let that be the last word. Happy
birthday, Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Suddenly the room was filled with a bluish light. A few seconds later
they heard the crash of thunder and the whole house shook.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have to go,&rdquo; said Sophie. She got up and ran to the
front door. As she let herself out, Hermes woke up from his nap in
the hallway. She thought she heard him say, &ldquo;See you later,
Hilde.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie rushed down the stairs and ran out into the street. It was
deserted. And now the rain came down in torrents.</P>
<p>
One or two cars were plowing through the downpour, but there were no
buses in sight. Sophie ran across Main Square and on through the
town. As she ran, one thought kept going round and round in her mind:
&ldquo;Tomorrow is my birthday* Isn&rsquo;t it extra bitter to
realize that life is only a dream on the day before your fifteenth
birthday? It&rsquo;s like dreaming you won a million and then just as
you&rsquo;re getting the money you wake up.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie ran across the squelching playing field. Minutes later she saw
someone come running toward her. It was her mother. The sky was
pierced again and again by angry darts of lightning.</P>
<p>
When they reached each other Sophie&rsquo;s mother put her arm around
her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening to us, little one?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sophie sobbed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
like a bad dream.&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>Bjerkely</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;an old magic mirror Great-grandmother had bought from a Gypsy
woman ...</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Hilde Moller Knag awoke in the attic room in the old captain&rsquo;s
house outside Lillesand. She glanced at the clock. It was only six
o&rsquo;clock, but it was already light. Broad rays of morning sun
lit up the room.</P>
<p>
She got out of bed and went to the window. On the way she stopped by
the desk and tore a page off her calendar. Thursday, June 14, 1990.
She crumpled the page up and threw it in her wastebasket.</P>
<p>
Friday, June 15, 1990, said the calendar now, shining at her. Way
back in January she had written &ldquo;15th birthday&rdquo; on
this page. She felt it was extra-special to be fifteen on the
fifteenth. It would never happen again.</P>
<p>
Fifteen! Wasn&rsquo;t this the first day of her adult life? She
couldn&rsquo;t just go back to bed. Furthermore, it was the last day
of school before the summer vacation. The students just had to appear
in church at one o&rsquo;clock. And what was more, in a week Dad
would be home from Lebanon. He had promised to be home for Midsummer
Eve.</P>
<p>
Hilde stood by the window and looked out over the garden, down toward
the dock behind the little red boat-house. The motorboat had not yet
been brought out for the summer, but the old rowboat was tied up to
the dock. She must remember to bail the water out of it after last
night&rsquo;s heavy downpour.</P>
<p>
As she was looking out over the little bay, she remembered the
time when as a little girl of six she had climbed up into the rowboat
and rowed out into the bay alone. She had fallen overboard and it was
all she could do to struggle ashore. Drenched to the skin, she had
pushed her way through the thicket hedge. As she stood in the garden
looking up at the house, her mother had come running toward her. The
boat and both oars were left afloat in the bay. She still dreamed
about the boat sometimes, drifting on its own, abandoned. It had been
an embarrassing experience.</P>
<p>
The garden was neither especially luxuriant nor particularly
well kept. But it was large and it was Hilde&rsquo;s. A
weather-beaten apple tree and a few practically barren fruit bushes
had just about survived the severe winter storms. The old glider
stood on the lawn between granite rocks and thicket. It looked so
forlorn in the sharp morning light. Even more so because the
cushions had been taken in. Mom had probably hurried out late last
night and rescued them from the rain.</P>
<p>
There were birch trees&mdash;bj0rketreer&mdash;all around the large
garden, sheltering it partly, at least, from the worst squalls. It
was because of those trees that the house had been renamed Bjerkely
over a hundred years ago.</P>
<p>
Hilde&rsquo;s great-grandfather had built the house some years before
the turn of the century. He had been a captain on one of the
last tall sailing ships. There were a lot of people who continued to
call it the captain&rsquo;s house.</P>
<p>
That morning the garden still showed signs of the heavy rain that had
suddenly started late last evening. Hilde had been awakened several
times by bursts of thunder. But today there was not a cloud in the
sky.</P>
<p>
Everything is so fresh after a summer storm like that. It had been
hot and dry for several weeks and the tips of the leaves on the birch
trees had started to turn yellow. Now it was as if the whole
world had been newly washed. It seemed as if even her childhood had
been washed away with the storm.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, there is pain when spring buds burst...&rdquo; Wasn&rsquo;t
there a Swedish poet who had said something like that? Or was she
Finnish?</P>
<p>
Hilde stood in front of the heavy brass mirror hanging on the wall
above Grandmother&rsquo;s old dresser.</P>
<p>
Was she pretty? She wasn&rsquo;t ugly, anyway. Maybe she was kind of
in-between ...</P>
<p>
She had long, fair hair. Hilde had always wished her hair could be
either a bit fairer or a bit darker. This in-between color was so
mousy. On the positive side, there were these soft curls. Lots of her
friends struggled to get their hair to curl just a little bit, but
Hilde&rsquo;s hair had always been naturally curly. Another positive
feature, she thought, were her deep green eyes. &ldquo;Are they
really green?&rdquo; her aunts and uncles used to say as they bent
over to look at her.</P>
<p>
Hilde considered whether the image she was studying was that of a
girl or that of a young woman. She decided it was neither. The body
might be quite womanly, but the face reminded her of an unripe apple.</P>
<p>
There was something about this old mirror that always made Hilde
think of her father. It had once hung down in the &ldquo;studio.&rdquo;
The studio, over the boathouse, was her father&rsquo;s combined
library, writer&rsquo;s workshop, and retreat. Albert, as Hilde
called him when he was home, had always wanted to write something
significant. Once he had tried to write a novel, but he never
finished it. From time to time he had had a few poems and sketches of
the archipelago published in a national journal. Hilde was so proud
every time she saw his name in print. ALBERT KNAG. It meant something
in Lillesan^, anyway. Her great-grandfather&rsquo;s name had also
been Albert.</P>
<p>
The mirror. Many years ago her father had joked about not being able
to wink at your own reflection with both eyes at the same time,
except in this brass mirror. It was an exception because it was an
old magic mirror Great-grandmother had bought from a Gypsy woman just
after her wedding.</P>
<p>
Hilde had tried for ages, but it was just as hard to wink at yourself
with both eyes as to run away from your own shadow. In the end she
had been given the old family heirloom to keep. Through the years she
had tried from time to time to master the impossible art.</P>
<p>
Not surprisingly, she was pensive today. And not unnaturally,
she was preoccupied with herself. Fifteen years old ...</P>
<p>
She happened to glance at her bedside table. There was a large
package there. It had pretty blue wrapping and was tied with a red
silk ribbon. It must be a birthday present!</P>
<p>
Could this be the present? The great big present from Dad that had
been so very secret? He had dropped so many cryptic hints in his
cards from Lebanon. But he had &ldquo;imposed a severe censorship on
himself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The present was something that &ldquo;grew bigger and bigger,&rdquo;
he had written. Then he had said something about a girl she was soon
to meet&mdash;and that he had sent copies of all his cards to her.
Hilde had tried to pump her mother for clues, but she had no idea
what he meant, either.</P>
<p>
The oddest hint had been that the present could perhaps be
&ldquo;shared with other people.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t working for
the UN for nothing! If her father had one bee in his bonnet&mdash;and
he had plenty&mdash;it was that the. UN ought to be a kind of world
government. May the UN one day really be able to unite the whole of
humanity, he had written on one of his cards.</P>
<p>
Was she allowed to open the package before her mother came up to her
room singing &ldquo;Happy Birthday to You,&rdquo; with pastry and a
Norwegian flag? Surely that was why it had been put there?</P>
<p>
She walked quietly across the room and picked up the package. It was
heavy! She found the tag: To Hilde on her 15th birthday from Dad.</P>
<p>
She sat on the bed and carefully untied the red silk ribbon. Then she
undid the blue paper.</P>
<p>
It was a large ring binder.</P>
<p>
Was this her present? Was this the fifteenth-birthday present that
there had been so much fuss about? The present that grew bigger and
bigger and could be shared with other people?</P>
<p>
A quick glance showed that the ring binder was rilled with
typewritten pages. Hilde recognized them as being from her father&rsquo;s
typewriter, the one he had taken with him to Lebanon.</P>
<p>
Had he written a whole book for her?</P>
<p>
On the first page, in large handwritten letters, was the title,
SOPHIE&rsquo;S WORLD.</P>
<p>
Farther down the page there were two typewritten lines of poetry:</P>
<p>
TRUE ENLIGHTENMENT IS TO MAN LIKE SUNLIGHT TO THE SOIL</P>
<p>
&mdash;N.F.S. Grundtvig</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Hilde turned to the next page, to the beginning of the first chapter.
It was entitled &ldquo;The Garden of Eden.&rdquo; She got into bed,
sat up comfortably, resting the ring binder against her knees, and
began to read.</P>
<p>
Sophie Amundsen was on her way home
from school. She had walked the first part of the way with Joanna.
They had been discussing robots. Joanna thought the human brain was
like an advanced computer. Sophie was not certain she agreed.
Surely a person was more than a piece of hardware?</P>
<p>
Hilde read on, oblivious of all else, even forgetting that it was her
birthday. From time to time a brief thought crept in between the
lines as she read: Had Dad written a book? Had he finally begun on
the significant novel and completed it in Lebanon? He had often
complained that time hung heavily on one&rsquo;s hands in that
part of the world.</P>
<p>
Sophie&rsquo;s father was far from home, too. She was probably the
girl Hilde would be getting to know ...</P>
<p>
Only by conjuring up an intense
feeling of one day being dead could she appreciate how terribly good
life was... . Where does the world come from? ... At some point
something must have come from nothing. But was that possible?
Wasn&rsquo;t that just as impossible as the idea that the world
had always existed?</P>
<p>
Hilde read on and on. With surprise, she read about Sophie Amundsen
receiving a postcard from Lebanon: &ldquo;Hilde Moller Knag, c/o
Sophie Amundsen, 3 Clover Close...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, Happy 15th birthday. As
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll understand, I want to give you a present
that will help you grow. Forgive me for sending the card c/o Sophie.
It was the easiest way. Love from Dad.</P>
<p>
The joker! Hilde knew her father had always been a sly one, but today
he had really taken her by surprise! Instead of tying the card
on the package, he had written it into the book.</P>
<p>
But poor Sophie! She must have been totally confused!</P>
<p>
Why would a father send a birthday
card to Sophie&rsquo;s address when it was quite obviously intended
to go somewhere else? What kind of father would cheat his own
daughter of a birthday card by purposely sending it astray? How could
it be &ldquo;the easiest way&rdquo;? And above all, how was she
supposed to trace this Hilde person?</P>
<p>
No, how could she?</P>
<p>
Hilde turned a couple of pages and began to read the second chapter,
&ldquo;The Top Hat.&rdquo; She soon came to the long letter which a
mysterious person had written to Sophie.</P>
<p>
Being interested in why we are here is
not a &ldquo;casual&rdquo; interest like collecting stamps. People
who ask such questions are taking part in a debate that has gone on
as long as man has lived on this planet.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sophie was completely exhausted.&rdquo; So was Hilde. Not only
had Dad written a book for her fifteenth birthday, he had written a
strange and wonderful book.</P>
<p>
To summarize briefly: A white rabbit
is pulled out of a top hat. Because it is an extremely large rabbit,
the trick takes many billions of years. All mortals are born at the
very tip of the rabbit&rsquo;s fine hairs, where they are in a
position to wonder at the impossibility of the trick. But as they
grow older they work themselves ever deeper into the fur. And there
they stay . . .</P>
<p>
Sophie was not the only one who felt she had been on the point of
finding herself a comfortable place deep down in the rabbit&rsquo;s
fur. Today was Hilde&rsquo;s fifteenth birthday, and she had the
feeling it was time to decide which way she would choose to crawl.</P>
<p>
She read about the Greek natural philosophers. Hilde knew that her
father was interested in philosophy. He had written an article in the
newspaper proposing that philosophy should be a regular school
subject. It was called &ldquo;Why should philosophy be part of the
school curriculum?&rdquo; He had even raised the issue at a PTA
meeting in Hilde&rsquo;s class. Hilde had found it acutely
embarrassing.</P>
<p>
She looked at the clock. It was seven-thirty. It would probably be
half an hour before her mother came up with the breakfast tray, thank
goodness, because right now she was engrossed in Sophie and all the
philosophical questions. She read the chapter called &ldquo;Democritus.&rdquo;
First of all, Sophie got a question to think about: Why is Lego the
most ingenious toy in the world? Then she found a large brown
envelope in the mailbox:</P>
<p>
Democritus agreed with his
predecessors that transformations in nature could not be due to
the fact that anything actually &ldquo;changed.&rdquo; He therefore
assumed that everything was built up of tiny invisible blocks, each
of which was eternal and immutable. Democritus called these
smallest units atoms.</P>
<p>
Hilde was indignant when Sophie found the red silk scarf under her
bed. So that was where it was! But how could a scarf just disappear
into a story? It had to be someplace...</P>
<p>
The chapter on Socrates began with Sophie reading &ldquo;something
about the Norwegian UN battalion in Lebanon&rdquo; in the
newspaper. Typical Dad! He was so concerned that people in
Norway were not interested enough in the UN forces&rsquo;
peacekeeping task. If nobody else was, then Sophie would have to be.
In that way he could write it into his story and get some sort of
attention from the media.</P>
<p>
She had to smile as she read the P.P.S. in the philosophy
teacher&rsquo;s letter to Sophie:</P>
<p>
If you should come across a red silk
scarf anywhere, please take care of it. Sometimes personal property
gets mixed up. Especially at school and places like that, and this is
a philosophy school.</P>
<p>
Hilde heard her mother&rsquo;s footsteps on the stairs. Before
she knocked on the door, Hilde had begun to read about Sophie&rsquo;s
discovery of the video of Athens in her secret den.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Happy birthday ...&rdquo; Her mother had begun to sing halfway
up the stairs.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Hilde, in the middle of the passage where
the philosophy teacher was talking directly to Sophie from the
Acropolis. He looked almost exactly like Hilde&rsquo;s father&mdash;with
a &ldquo;black, well-trimmed beard&rdquo; and a blue beret.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Happy birthday, Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Just put it there.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to ... ?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You can see I&rsquo;m reading.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Imagine, you&rsquo;re fifteen!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you ever been to Athens, Mom?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, why do you ask?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so amazing that those old temples are still
standing. They are actually 2,500 years old. The biggest one is
called the Virgin&rsquo;s Place, by the way.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you opened your present from Dad?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What present?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;You must look up now, Hilde. You&rsquo;re in a complete
daze.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde let the large ring binder slide down onto her lap.</P>
<p>
Her mother stood leaning over the bed with the tray. On it were
lighted candles, buttered rolls with shrimp salad, and a soda. There
was also a small package. Her mother stood awkwardly holding the tray
with both hands, with a flag under one arm.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, thanks a lot, Mom. It&rsquo;s sweet of you, but I&rsquo;m
really busy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go to school till one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Not until now did Hilde remember where she was, and her mother put
the tray down on the bedside table.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorry, Mom. I was completely absorbed in this.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is it he has written, Hilde? I&rsquo;ve been just as
mystified as you. It&rsquo;s been impossible to get a sensible word
out of him for months.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
For some reason Hilde felt embarrassed. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just a
story.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A story?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, a story. And a history of philosophy. Or something like
that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to open the package from me?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde didn&rsquo;t want to be unfair, so she opened her mother&rsquo;s
present right away. It was a gold bracelet.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely, Mom! Thank you very much!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde got out of bed and gave her mother a hug.</P>
<p>
They sat talking for a while.</P>
<p>
Then Hilde said, &ldquo;I have to get back to the book, Mom. Right
now he&rsquo;s standing on top of the Acropolis.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Who is?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. Neither has Sophie. That&rsquo;s the whole
point.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I have to get to work. Don&rsquo;t forget to eat
something. Your dress is on a hanger downstairs.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Finally her mother disappeared down the stairs. So did Sophie&rsquo;s
philosophy teacher; he walked down the steps from the Acropolis and
stood on the Areopagos rock before appearing a little later in the
old square of Athens.</P>
<p>
Hilde shivered when the old buildings suddenly rose from the ruins.
One of her father&rsquo;s pet ideas had been to let all the United
Nations countries collaborate in reconstructing an exact copy of
the Athenian square. It would be the forum for philosophical
discussion and also for disarmament talks. He felt that a giant
project like that would forge world unity. &ldquo;We have, after all,
succeeded in building oil rigs and moon rockets.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Then she read about Plato. &ldquo;The soul yearns to fly home on the
wings of love to the world of ideas. It longs to be freed from the
chains of the body ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie had crawled through the hedge and followed Hermes, but the dog
had escaped her. After having read about Plato, she had gone farther
into the woods and come upon the red cabin by the little lake. Inside
hung a painting of Bjerkely. From the description it was clearly
meant to be Hilde&rsquo;s Bjerkely. But there was also a portrait of
a man named Berkeley. &ldquo;How odd!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde laid the heavy ring binder aside on the bed and went over to
her bookshelf and looked him up in the three-volume encyclopedia she
had been given on her fourteenth birthday. Here he was&mdash;Berkeley!</P>
<p>
Berkeley, George, 1685-1753, Eng. Philos., Bishop of Cloyne. Denied
existence of a material world beyond the human mind. Our sense
perceptions proceed from God. Main work: A Treatise Concerning
the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710).</P>
<p>
Yes, it was decidedly odd. Hilde stood thinking for a few seconds
before going back to bed and the ring binder.</P>
<p>
In one way, it was her father who had hung the two pictures on the
wall. Could there be any connection other than the similarity of
names?</P>
<p>
Berkeley was a philosopher who denied the existence of a material
world beyond the human mind. That was certainly very strange, one had
to admit. But it was not easy to disprove such claims, either. As
regards Sophie, it fitted very well. After all, Hilde&rsquo;s father
was responsible for her &ldquo;sense perceptions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Well, she would know more if she read on. Hilde looked up from the
ring binder and smiled when she got to the point where Sophie
discovers the reflection of a girl who winks with both eyes. &ldquo;The
other girl had winked at Sophie as if to say: I can see you, Sophie.
I am here, on the other side.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie finds the green wallet in the cabin as well&mdash; with the
money and everything! How could it have made its way there?</P>
<p>
Absurd! For a second or two Hilde had really believed that Sophie had
found it. But then she tried to imagine how the whole thing must
appear to Sophie. It must all seem quite inscrutable and uncanny.</P>
<p>
For the first time Hilde felt a strong desire to meet Sophie face to
face. She felt like telling her the real truth about the whole
business.</P>
<p>
But now Sophie had to get out of the cabin before she was caught
red-handed. The boat was adrift on the lake, of course. (Her father
couldn&rsquo;t resist reminding her of that old story, could he!)</P>
<p>
Hilde gulped a mouthful of soda and took a bite of her roll while she
read the letter about the &ldquo;meticulous&rdquo; Aristotle, who had
criticized Plato&rsquo;s theories.</P>
<p>
Aristotle pointed out that nothing
exists in consciousness that has not first been experienced by
the senses. Plato would have said that there is nothing in the
natural world that has not first existed in the world of ideas.
Aristotle held that Plato was thus &ldquo;doubling the number of
things.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde had not known that it was Aristotle who had invented the
game of &ldquo;animal, vegetable, or mineral.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Aristotle wanted to do a thorough
clearing up in nature&rsquo;s &ldquo;room.&rdquo; He tried to
show that everything in nature belongs to different categories and
subcategories.</P>
<p>
When she read about Aristotle&rsquo;s view of women she was both
irritated and disappointed. Imagine being such a brilliant
philosopher and yet such a crass idiot!</P>
<p>
Aristotle had inspired Sophie to clean up her own room. And there,
together with all the other stuff, she found the white stocking which
had disappeared from Hilde&rsquo;s closet a month ago! Sophie put all
the pages she had gotten from Alberto into a ring binder. &ldquo;There
were in all over fifty pages.&rdquo; For her own part, Hilde had
gotten up to page 124, but then she also had Sophie&rsquo;s story on
top of all the correspondence from Alberto Knox.</P>
<p>
The next chapter was called &ldquo;Hellenism.&rdquo; First of all,
Sophie finds a postcard with a picture of a UN jeep. It is stamped UN
Battalion, June 15. Another of these &ldquo;cards&rdquo; to Hilde
that her father had put into the story instead of sending by mail.</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, I assume you are still
celebrating your fifteenth birthday. Or is this the morning after?
Anyway, it makes no difference to your present. In a sense, that
will last a lifetime. But I&rsquo;d like to wish you a happy birthday
one more time. Perhaps you understand now why I send the cards
to Sophie. I am sure she will pass them on to you.</P>
<p>
P.S. Mom said you had lost your
wallet. I hereby promise to reimburse you the 150 crowns. You will
probably be able to get another school I.D. before they close for the
summer vacation. Love from Dad.</P>
<p>
Not bad! That made her 150 crowns richer. He probably thought a
homemade present alone wasn&rsquo;t enough.</P>
<p>
So it appeared that June 15 was Sophie&rsquo;s birthday, too. But
Sophie&rsquo;s calendar had only gotten as far as the middle of May.
That must have been when her father had written this chapter, and he
had postdated the &ldquo;birthday card&rdquo; to Hilde. But poor
Sophie, running down to the supermarket to meet Joanna.</P>
<p>
Who was Hilde? How could her father as
good as take it for granted that Sophie would find her? In any case,
it was senseless of him to send Sophie the cards instead of sending
them directly to his daughter.</P>
<p>
Hilde, like Sophie, was elevated to the celestial spheres as she read
about Plotinus.</P>
<p>
I believe there is something of the
divine mystery in everything that exists. We can see it sparkle in a
sunflower or a poppy. We sense more of the unfathomable
mystery in a butterfly that flutters from a twig&mdash; or in a
goldfish swimming in a bowl. But we are closest to God in our
own soul. Only there can we become one with the greatest mystery
of life. In truth, at very rare moments we can experience that we
ourselves are that divine mystery.</P>
<p>
This was the most giddying passage Hilde had read up to now. But it
was nevertheless the simplest. Everything is one, and this &ldquo;one&rdquo;
is a divine mystery that everyone shares.</P>
<p>
This was not really something you needed to believe. It is so,
thought Hilde. So everyone can read what they like into the word
&ldquo;divine.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She turned quickly to the next chapter. Sophie and Joanna go camping
the night before the national holiday on May 17. They make their way
to the major&rsquo;s cabin...</P>
<p>
Hilde had not read many pages before she flung the bedclothes angrily
aside, got up, and began to walk up and down, clutching the ring
binder in her hands.</P>
<p>
This was just about the most impudent trick she had ever heard of. In
that little hut in the woods, her father lets these two girls find
copies of all the cards he had sent Hilde in the first two weeks of
May. And the copies were real enough. Hilde had read the very same
words over and over. She recognized every single word.</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, I am now so bursting with
all these secrets for your birthday that I have to stop myself
several times a day from calling home and blowing the whole
thing. It is something that simply grows and grows. And as you know,
when a thing gets bigger and bigger it&rsquo;s more difficult to keep
it to yourself. . .</P>
<p>
Sophie gets a new lesson from Alberto. It&rsquo;s all about Jews and
Greeks and the two great cultures. Hilde liked getting this wide
bird&rsquo;s-eye view of history. She had never learned anything like
it at school. They only gave you details and more details. She now
saw Jesus and Christianity in a completely new light.</P>
<p>
She liked the quote from Goethe: &ldquo;He who cannot draw on three
thousand years is living from hand to mouth.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The next chapter began with a piece of card which sticks to Sophie&rsquo;s
kitchen window. It is a new birthday card for Hilde, of course.</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, I don&rsquo;t know whether
it will still be your birthday when you read this card. I hope so, in
a way; or at least that not too many days have gone by. A week or two
for Sophie does not have to mean just as long for us. I shall be
coming home for Midsummer Eve, so we can sit together for hours
in the glider, looking out over the sea, Hilde. We have so much to
talk about. . .</P>
<p>
Then Alberto calls Sophie, and this is the first time she hears his
voice.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You make it sound like a war.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I would rather call it a battle
of wills. We have to attract Hilde&rsquo;s attention and get her over
on our side before her father comes home to Lillesand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
And then Sophie meets Alberto Knox disguised as a medieval monk in
the twelfth-century stone church.</P>
<p>
Oh, no, the church! Hilde looked at the time. A quarter past one
... She had forgotten all about the time.</P>
<p>
Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t matter so much that she cut school on her
birthday. But it did mean that her classmates wouldn&rsquo;t be
celebrating with her. Oh well, she had always had plenty of
well-wishers.</P>
<p>
Soon she found herself receiving a long sermon. Alberto had no
problem slipping into the role of a medieval priest.</P>
<p>
When she read about how Sophia had appeared to Hildegard in visions,
she turned once again to her encyclopedia. But this time she
found nothing about either of them. Wasn&rsquo;t that typical! As
soon as it was a question of women or something to do with
women, the encyclopedia was about as informative as a moon
crater. Was the whole work censored by the Society for the Protection
of Men?</P>
<p>
Hildegard of Bingen was a preacher, a writer, a doctor, a
botanist, and a biologist. She was &ldquo;perhaps an example of the
fact that women were often more practical, more scientific even,
in the Middle Ages.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
But there was not a single word about her in the encyclopedia.
How scandalous!</P>
<p>
Hilde had never heard that God had a &ldquo;female side&rdquo; or a
&ldquo;mother nature.&rdquo; Her name was Sophia, apparently&mdash;but
she was apparently not worth printer&rsquo;s ink, either.</P>
<p>
The nearest she could find in the encyclopedia was an entry about the
Santa Sophia Church in Constantinople (now Istanbul), named Hagia
Sophia, which means Sacred Wisdom. But there was nothing about
it being female. That was censorship, wasn&rsquo;t it?</P>
<p>
Otherwise, it was true enough that Sophie had revealed herself
to Hilde. She was picturing the girl with the straight hair all the
time ...</P>
<p>
When Sophie gets home after spending most of the morning in St.
Mary&rsquo;s Church, she stands in front of the brass mirror she took
home from the cabin in the woods.</P>
<p>
She studied the sharp contours of her
own pale face framed by that impossible hair which defied any style
but nature&rsquo;s own. But beyond that face was the apparition
of another girl.</P>
<p>
Suddenly the other girl began to wink
frantically with both eyes, as if to signal that she was really in
there on the other side. The apparition lasted only a few seconds.
Then she was gone.</P>
<p>
How many times had Hilde stood in front of the mirror like that as if
she was searching for someone else behind the glass? But how could
her father have known that?</P>
<p>
Wasn&rsquo;t it also a dark-haired woman she had been searching
for? Great-grandmother had bought it from a Gypsy woman, hadn&rsquo;t
she? Hilde felt her hands shaking as they held the book. She had the
feeling that Sophie really existed somewhere &ldquo;on the other
side.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Now Sophie is dreaming about Hilde and Bjerkely. Hilde can neither
see nor hear her, but then&mdash;Sophie finds Hilde&rsquo;s gold
crucifix on the dock. And the crucifix&mdash;with Hilde&rsquo;s
initials and everything&mdash;is in Sophie&rsquo;s bed when she wakes
after her dream!</P>
<p>
Hilde forced herself to think hard. Surely she hadn&rsquo;t lost her
crucifix as well? She went to her dresser and took out her jewelry
case. The crucifix, which she had received as a christening gift from
her grandmother, was not there!</P>
<p>
So she really had lost it. All right, but how had her father known it
when she didn&rsquo;t even know it herself?</P>
<p>
And another thing: Sophie had apparently dreamed that Hilde&rsquo;s
father came home from Lebanon. But there was still a week to go
before that happened. Was Sophie&rsquo;s dream prophetic? Did
her father mean that when he came home Sophie would somehow be there?
He had written that she would get a new friend ...</P>
<p>
In a momentary vision of absolute clarity Hilde knew that Sophie was
more than just paper and ink. She really existed.</P>
<br /><h3>The Enlightenent</h3><br />
<p>
...from the way needles are made to the way cannons are founded&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Hilde had just begun the chapter on the Renaissance when she heard
her mother come in the front door. She looked at the clock. It was
four in the afternoon.</P>
<p>
Her mother ran upstairs and opened Hilde&rsquo;s door.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you go to the church?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But... what did you wear?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m wearing now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Your nightgown?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old stone church from the Middle Ages.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She let the ring binder fall into her lap and looked up at her
mother.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I forgot the time, Mom. I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;m reading
something terribly exciting.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother could not help smiling.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a magic book,&rdquo; added Hilde.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay. Happy birthday once again, Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hey, I don&rsquo;t know if I can take that phrase any more.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t... I&rsquo;m just going to rest for a
while, then I&rsquo;ll start fixing a great dinner. I managed to get
hold of some strawberries.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll go on reading.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother left and Hilde read on.</P>
<p>
Sophie is following Hermes through the town. In Alberto&rsquo;s hall
she finds another card from Lebanon. This, too, is dated June 15.</P>
<p>
Hilde was just beginning to understand the system of the dates. The
cards dated before June 15 are copies of cards Hilde had already
received from her dad. But those with today&rsquo;s date are reaching
her for the first time via the ring binder.</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, Now Sophie is coming to
the philosopher&rsquo;s house. She will soon be fifteen, but you
were fifteen yesterday. Or is it today, Hilde? If it is today, it
must be late, then. But our watches do not always agree . . .</P>
<p>
Hilde read how Alberto told Sophie about the Renaissance and the
new science, the seventeenth-century rationalists and British
empiricism.</P>
<p>
She jumped at every new card and birthday greeting that her
father had stuck into the story. He got them to fall out of an
exercise book, turn up inside a banana skin, and hide inside a
computer program. Without the slightest effort, he could get Alberto
to make a slip of the tongue and call Sophie Hilde. On top of
everything else, he got Hermes to say &ldquo;Happy birthday, Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde agreed with Alberto that he was going a bit too far, comparing
himself with God and Providence. But whom was she actually agreeing
with? Wasn&rsquo;t it her father who put those reproachful&mdash;or
self-reproachful&mdash;words in Alberto&rsquo;s mouth? She decided
that the comparison with God was not so crazy after all. Her father
really was like an almighty God for Sophie&rsquo;s world.</P>
<p>
When Alberto got to Berkeley, Hilde was at least as enthralled as
Sophie had been. What would happen now? There had been all kinds of
hints that something special was going to happen as soon as they got
to that philosopher&mdash;who had denied the existence of a material
world outside human consciousness.</P>
<p>
The chapter begins with Alberto and Sophie standing at the window,
seeing the little plane with the long Happy Birthday streamer waving
behind it. At the same time dark clouds begin to gather over the
town.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So &lsquo;to be or not to be&rsquo;
is not the whole question. The question is also who we are. Are we
really human beings of flesh and blood? Does our world consist
of real things&mdash;or are we encircled by the mind?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Not so surprising that Sophie starts biting her nails. Nail-biting
had never been one of Hilde&rsquo;s bad habits but she didn&rsquo;t
feel particularly pleased with herself right now. Then finally it was
all out in the open: &ldquo;For us&mdash; for you and me&mdash;this
&lsquo;will or spirit&rsquo; that is the &lsquo;cause of everything
in everything&rsquo; could be Hilde&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you saying he&rsquo;s been
a kind of God for us?&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To   be   perfectly  candid,
yes.He  should   be ashamed of himself!&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What about Hilde herself?&rdquo;

</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She is an angel, Sophie.&rdquo;

</P>
<p>
&ldquo;An angel?&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde is the one this &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;
turns to.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
With that, Sophie tears herself away from Alberto and runs out into
the storm. Could it be the same storm that raged over Bjerkely last
night&mdash;a few hours after Sophie ran through the town?</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
As she ran, one thought kept going
round and round in her mind: &ldquo;Tomorrow is my birthday*. Isn&rsquo;t
it extra bitter to realize that life is only a dream on the day
before your fifteenth birthday? It&rsquo;s like dreaming you won
a million and then just as you&rsquo;re getting the money you wake
up.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie ran across the squelching
playing field. Minutes later she saw someone come running toward her.
It was her mother. The sky was pierced again and again by angry darts
of lightning.</P>
<p>
When they reached each other Sophie&rsquo;s
mother put her arm around her.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening to us,
little one?&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
Sophie sobbed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a bad dream.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde felt the tears start. &ldquo;To be or not to be&mdash;that is
the question.&rdquo; She threw the ring binder to the end of the bed
and stood up. She walked back and forth across the floor. At last she
stopped in front of the brass mirror, where she remained until her
mother came to say dinner was ready. When Hilde heard the knock on
the door, she had no idea how long she had been standing there.</P>
<p>
But she was sure, she was perfectly sure, that her reflection
had winked with both eyes.</P>
<p>
She tried to be the grateful birthday girl all through dinner. But
her thoughts were with Sophie and Alberto all the time.</P>
<p>
How would things go for them now that they knew it was Hilda&rsquo;s
father who decided everything? Although &ldquo;knew&rdquo; was
perhaps an exaggeration. It was nonsense to think they knew anything
at all. Wasn&rsquo;t it only her father who let them know things?</P>
<p>
Still, the problem was the same however you looked at it. As soon as
Sophie and Alberto &ldquo;knew&rdquo; how everything hung together,
they were in a way at the end of the road.</P>
<p>
She almost choked on a mouthful of food as she suddenly realized
that the same problem possibly applied to her own world too. People
had progressed steadily in their understanding of natural laws. Could
history simply continue to all eternity once the last piece of the
jigsaw puzzle of philosophy and science had fallen into place? Wasn&rsquo;t
there a connection between the development of ideas and science on
the one hand, and the greenhouse effect and deforestation on the
other? Maybe it was not so crazy to call man&rsquo;s thirst for
knowledge a fall from grace?</P>
<p>
The question was so huge and so terrifying that Hilde tried to forget
it again. She would probably understand much more as she read further
in her father&rsquo;s birthday book.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Happy birthday to you ...,&rdquo; sang her mother when they
were done with their ice cream and Italian strawberries. &ldquo;Now
we&rsquo;ll do whatever you choose.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I know it sounds a bit crazy, but all I want to do is read my
present from Dad.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, as long as he doesn&rsquo;t make you completely
delirious.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No way.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We could share a pizza while we watch that mystery on TV.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, if you like.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde suddenly thought of the way Sophie spoke to her mother. Dad had
hopefully not written any of Hilde&rsquo;s mother into the character
of the other mother? Just to make sure, she decided not to mention
the white rabbit being pulled out of the top hat. Not today, at
least.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; she said as she was leaving the table.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find my gold crucifix anywhere.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother looked at her with an enigmatic expression.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I found it down by the dock weeks ago. You must have dropped
it, you untidy scamp.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you mention it to Dad?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me think ... yes, I believe I may have.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Where is it then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother got up and went to get her own jewelry case. Hilde heard a
little cry of surprise from the bedroom. She came quickly back
into the living room.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Right now I can&rsquo;t seem to find it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought as much.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She gave her mother a hug and ran upstairs to her room. At last&mdash;now
she could read on about Sophie and Alberto. She sat up on the bed as
before with the heavy ring binder resting against her knees and began
the next chapter.</P>
<p>
Sophie woke up the next morning when
her mother came into the room carrying a tray loaded with birthday
presents. She had stuck a flag in an empty soda bottle.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Happy birthday, Sophie!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie rubbed the sleep from her eyes.
She tried to remember what had happened the night before. But it was
all like jumbled pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. One of the pieces was
Alberto, another was Hilde and the major. A third was Berkeley, a
fourth Bjerkely. The blackest piece of all was the violent storm. She
had practically been in shock. Her mother had rubbed her dry with a
towel and simply put her to bed with a cup of hot milk and honey. She
had fallen asleep immediately.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m still alive,&rdquo;
she said weakly.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re alive!
And today you are fifteen years old.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you quite sure?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite sure. Shouldn&rsquo;t a
mother know when her only child was born? June 15, 1975 ... and
half-past one, Sophie. It was the happiest moment of my life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you sure it isn&rsquo;t all
only a dream?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It must be a good dream to wake
up to rolls and soda and birthday presents.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She put the tray of presents on a
chair and disappeared out of the room for a second. When she came
back she was carrying another tray with rolls and soda. She put it on
the end of the bed.</P>
<p>
It was the signal for the traditional
birthday morning ritual, with the unpacking of presents and her
mother&rsquo;s sentimental flights back to her first contractions
fifteen years ago. Her mother&rsquo;s present was a tennis racket.
Sophie had never played tennis, but there were some open-air
courts a few minutes from Clover Close. Her father had sent her a
mini-TV and FM radio. The screen was no bigger than an ordinary
photograph. There were also presents from old aunts and friends
of the family.</P>
<p>
Presently her mother said, &ldquo;Do
you think I should stay home from work today?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, why should you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You were very upset yesterday.
If it goes on, I think we should make an appointment to see a
psychiatrist.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be necessary.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was it the storm&mdash;or was
it Alberto?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What about you? You said:
What&rsquo;s happening to us, little one?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I was thinking of you running
around town to meet some mysterious person ... Maybe it&rsquo;s my
fault.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not anybody&rsquo;s
&lsquo;fault&rsquo; that I&rsquo;m taking a course in philosophy in
my leisure time. Just go to work. School doesn&rsquo;t start till
ten, and we&rsquo;re only getting our grades and sitting around.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;re
going to get?&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;More than I got last semester
at any rate.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Not long after her mother had gone the
telephone rang.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sophie Amundsen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is Alberto.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The major didn&rsquo;t spare
any ammunition last night.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The thunderstorm, Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to
think.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is the finest virtue a
genuine philosopher can have. I am proud of how much you have learned
in such a short time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am scared that nothing is
real.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s called existential
angst, or dread, and is as a rule only a stage on the way to new
consciousness.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I need a break from the
course.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are there that many frogs in
the garden at the moment?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie started to laugh. Alberto
continued: &ldquo;I think it would be better to persevere. Happy
birthday, by the way. We must complete the course by Midsummer Eve.
It&rsquo;s our last chance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Our last chance for what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you sitting comfortably?
We&rsquo;re going to have to spend some time on this, you
understand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sitting down.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You remember Descartes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think, therefore I am?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;With regard to our own
methodical doubt, we are right now starting from scratch. We don&rsquo;t
even know whether we think. It may turn out that we are thoughts, and
that is quite different from thinking. We have good reason to believe
that we have merely been invented by Hilde&rsquo;s father as a kind
of birthday diversion for the major&rsquo;s daughter from Lillesand.
Do you see?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But therein also lies a
built-in contradiction. If we are fictive, we have no right to
&lsquo;believe&rsquo; anything at all. In which case this whole
telephone conversation is purely imaginary.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And we haven&rsquo;t the
tiniest bit of free will because it&rsquo;s the major who plans
everything we say and do. So we can just as well hang up now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, now you&rsquo;re
oversimplifying things.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Explain it, then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you claim that people
plan everything they dream? It may be that Hilde&rsquo;s father knows
everything we do. It may be just as difficult to escape his
omniscience as it is to run away from your own shadow. However&mdash;
and this is where I have begun to devise a plan&mdash;it is not
certain that the major has already decided on everything that is to
happen. He may not decide before the very last minute&mdash;that is
to say, in the moment of creation. Precisely at such moments we may
possibly have an initiative of our own which guides what we say and
do. Such an initiative would naturally constitute extremely weak
impulses compared to the major&rsquo;s heavy artillery. We are very
likely defenseless against intrusive external forces such as talking
dogs, messages in bananas, and thunderstorms booked in advance. But
we cannot rule out our stubbornness, however weak it may be.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How could that be possible?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The major naturally knows
everything about our little world, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he is
all powerful. At any rate we must try to live as if he is not.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I see where you&rsquo;re
going with this.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The trick would be if we could
manage to do something all on our own&mdash;something the major would
not be able to discover.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How can we do that if we don&rsquo;t
even exist?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Who said we don&rsquo;t exist?
The question is not whether we are, but what we are and who we are.
Even if it turns out that we are merely impulses in the major&rsquo;s
dual personality, that need not take our little bit of existence
away from us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Or our free will?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on it,
Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But Hilde&rsquo;s father must
be fully aware that you are working on it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Decidedly so. But he doesn&rsquo;t
know what the actual plan is. I am attempting to find an Archimedian
point.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;An Archimedian point?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Archimedes was a Greek
scientist who said &lsquo;Give me a firm point on which to stand and
I will move the earth.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the kind of point we must
find to move ourselves out of the major&rsquo;s inner universe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That would be quite a feat.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t manage to
slip away before we have finished the philosophy course. While that
lasts he has much too firm a grip on us. He has clearly decided that
I am to guide you through the centuries right up to our own time. But
we only have a few days left before he boards a plane somewhere down
in the Middle East. If we haven&rsquo;t succeeded in detaching
ourselves from his gluey imagination before he arrives at Bjerkely,
we are done for.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re frightening me!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;First of all I shall give you
the most important facts about the French Enlightenment. Then we
shall take the main outline of Kant&rsquo;s philosophy so that we can
get to Romanticism. Hegel will also be a significant part of the
picture for us. And in talking about him we will unavoidably
touch on Kierkegaard&rsquo;s indignant clash with Hegelian
philosophy. We shall briefly talk about Marx, Darwin, and Freud. And
if we can manage a few closing comments on Sartre and
Existentialism, our plan can be put into operation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an awful lot for
one week.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we must begin
at once. Can you come over right away?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have to go to school. We are
having a class get-together and then we get our grades.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Drop it. If we are only
fictive, it&rsquo;s pure imagination that candy and soda have any
taste.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But my grades ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sophie, either you are living
in a wondrous universe on a tiny planet in one of many hundred
billion galaxies&mdash; or else you are the result of a few
electromagnetic impulses in the major&rsquo;s mind. And you are
talking about grades! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d better go to
school before we meet. It might have a bad influence on Hilde if you
cut your last school-day. She probably goes to school even on her
birthday. She is an angel, you know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll come straight
from school.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We can meet at the major&rsquo;s
cabin.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The major&rsquo;s cabin?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
... Click!</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Hilde let the ring binder slide into her lap. Her father had given
her conscience a dig there&mdash;she did cut her last day at school.
How sneaky of him!</P>
<p>
She sat for a while wondering what the plan was that Alberto was
devising. Should she sneak a look at the last page? No, that would be
cheating. She&rsquo;d better hurry up and read it to the end.</P>
<p>
But she was convinced Alberto was right on one important point.
One thing was that her father had an overview of what was going
to happen to Sophie and Alberto. But while he was writing, he
probably didn&rsquo;t know everything that would happen. He might
dash off something in a great hurry, something he might not notice
till long after he had written it. In a situation like that Sophie
and Alberto would have a certain amount of leeway.</P>
<p>
Once again Hilde had an almost transfiguring conviction that
Sophie and Alberto really existed. Still waters run deep, she thought
to herself.</P>
<p>
Why did that idea come to her?</P>
<p>
It was certainly not a thought that rippled the surface.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
At school, Sophie received lots of
attention because it was her birthday. Her classmates were already
keyed up by thoughts of summer vacation, and grades, and the sodas on
the last day of school. The minute the teacher dismissed the class
with her best wishes for the vacation, Sophie ran home. Joanna tried
to slow her down but Sophie called over her shoulder that there was
something she just had to do.</P>
<p>
In the mailbox she found two cards
from Lebanon. They were both birthday cards: HAPPY BIRTHDAY&mdash;15
YEARS. One of them was to &ldquo;Hilde M0ller Knag, c/o Sophie
Amundsen . . .&rdquo; But the other one was to Sophie herself. Both
cards were stamped &ldquo;UN Battalion&mdash;June 15.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie read her own card first:</P>
<p>
Dear Sophie Amundsen, Today you are
getting a card as well. Happy birthday, Sophie, and many thanks for
everything you have done for Hilde. Best regards, Major Albert Knag.</P>
<p>
Sophie was not sure how to react, now
that Hilde&rsquo;s father had finally written to her too. Hilde&rsquo;s
card read:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, I have no idea what day or
time it is in Lillesand. But, as I said, it doesn&rsquo;t make much
difference. If I know you, I am not too late for a last, or next
to last, greeting from down here. But don&rsquo;t stay up too late!
Alberto will soon be telling you about the French Enlightenment. He
will concentrate on seven points. They are:</P>
<p>
1. Opposition to authority</P>
<p>
2. Rationalism</P>
<p>
3. The enlightenment movement</P>
<p>
4. Cultural optimism</P>
<p>
5. The return to nature</P>
<p>
6. Natural religion</P>
<p>
7. Human rights</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
The major was obviously still keeping
his eye on them.</P>
<p>
Sophie let herself in and put her
report card with all the A&rsquo;s on the kitchen table. Then she
slipped through the hedge and ran into the woods.</P>
<p>
Soon she was once again rowing across
the little lake.</P>
<p>
Alberto was sitting on the doorstep
when she got to the cabin. He invited her to sit beside him. The
weather was fine although a slight mist of damp raw air was coming
off the lake. It was as though it had not quite recovered from the
storm.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going right
away,&rdquo; said Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;After Hume, the next great
philosopher was the German, Immanuel Kant. But France also had many
important thinkers in the eighteenth century. We could say that
the philosophical center of gravity h. Europe in the eighteenth
century was in England in the first half, in France in the middle,
and in Germany toward the end of it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A shift from west to east, in
other words.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Precisely. Let me outline some
of the ideas that many of the French Enlightenment philosophers had
in common. The important names are Montesquieu, Voltaire, and
Rousseau, but there were many, many others. I shall concentrate
on seven points.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thanks, that I am painfully
aware of.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie handed him the card from
Hilde&rsquo;s father. Alberto sighed deeply. &ldquo;He could
have saved himself the trouble ... the first key words, then, are
opposition to authority. Many of the French Enlightenment
philosophers visited England, which was in many ways more liberal
than their home country, and were intrigued by the English
natural sciences, especially Newton and his universal physics.
But they were also inspired by British philosophy, in particular by
Locke and his political philosophy. Once back in France, they
became increasingly opposed to the old authority. They thought
it was essential to remain skeptical of all inherited truths, the
idea being that the individual must find his own answer to every
question. The tradition of Descartes was very inspiring in this
respect.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because he was the one who
built everything up from the ground.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite so. The opposition to
authority was not least directed against the power of the clergy, the
king, and the nobility. During the eighteenth century, these
institutions had far more power in France than they had in
England.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then came the French
Revolution.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Yes, in 1789. But the
revolutionary ideas arose much earlier. The next key word is
rationalism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought rationalism went out
with Hume.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume himself did not die until
1776. That was about twenty years after Montesquieu and only two
years before Voltaire and Rousseau, who both died in 1778. But all
three had been to England and were familiar with the philosophy of
Locke. You may recall that Locke was not consistent in his
empiricism. He believed, for example, that faith in God and certain
moral norms were inherent in human reason. This idea is also the core
of the French Enlightenment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You also said that the French
have always been more rational than the British.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, a difference that goes
right back to the Middle Ages. When the British speak of &lsquo;common
sense,&rsquo; the French usually speak of &lsquo;evident.&rsquo; The
English expression means &lsquo;what everybody knows,&rsquo; the
French means &lsquo;what is obvious&rsquo;&mdash;to one&rsquo;s
reason, that is.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like the humanists of
antiquity&mdash;such as Socrates and the Stoics&mdash;most of the
Enlightenment philosophers had an unshakable faith in human reason.
This was so characteristic that the French Enlightenment is
often called the Age of Reason. The new natural sciences had revealed
that nature was subject to reason. Now the Enlightenment philosophers
saw it as their duty to lay a foundation for morals, religion, and
ethics in accordance with man&rsquo;s immutable reason. This led
to the enlightenment movement.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The third point.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now was the time to start
&lsquo;enlightening&rsquo; the masses. This was to be the basis for a
better society. People thought that poverty and oppression were the
fault of ignorance and superstition. Great attention was
therefore focused on the education of children and of the people. It
is no accident that the science of pedagogy was founded during the
Enlightenment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So schools date from the Middle
Ages, and pedagogy from the Enlightenment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You could say that. The
greatest monument to the enlightenment movement was
characteristically enough a huge encyclopedia. I refer to the
Encyclopedia in 28 volumes published during the years from 1751
to 1772. All the great philosophers and men of letters contributed to
it. &lsquo;Everything is to be found here,&rsquo; it was said, &lsquo;from
the way needles are made to the way cannons are founded.&rsquo; &ldquo;

</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The next point is cultural
optimism,&rdquo; Sophie said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you oblige me by putting
that card away while I am talking?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Enlightenment philosophers
thought that once reason and knowledge became widespread,
humanity would make great progress. It could only be a question of
time before irrationalism and ignorance would give way to an
&lsquo;enlightened&rsquo; humanity. This thought was dominant in
Western Europe until the last couple of decades. Today we are no
longer so convinced that all &lsquo;developments&rsquo; are to the
good.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But this criticism of
&lsquo;civilization&rsquo; was already being voiced by French
Enlightenment philosophers.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe we should have listened
to them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For some, the new catchphrase
was back to nature. But &lsquo;nature&rsquo; to the Enlightenment
philosophers meant almost the same as &lsquo;reason/ since human
reason was a gift of nature rather than of religion or of
&lsquo;civilization.&rsquo; It was observed that the so-called
primitive peoples were frequently both healthier and happier
than Europeans, and this, it was said, was because they had not been
&lsquo;civilized.&rsquo; Rousseau proposed the catchphrase, &lsquo;We
should return to nature.&rsquo; For nature is good, and man is &lsquo;by
nature&rsquo; good; it is civilization which ruins him. Rousseau
also believed that the child should be allowed to remain in its
&lsquo;naturally&rsquo; innocent state as long as possible. It would
not be wrong to say that the idea of the intrinsic value of childhood
dates from the Enlightenment. Previously, childhood had been
considered merely a preparation for adult life. But we are all human
beings&mdash;and we live our life on this earth, even when we are
children.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Religion, they thought, had to
be made natural.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What exactly did they mean by
that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They meant that religion also
had to be brought into harmony with &lsquo;natural&rsquo; reason.
There were many who fought for what one could call a natural
religion, and that is the sixth point on the list. At the time there
were a lot of confirmed materialists who did not believe in a God,
and who professed to atheism. But most of the Enlightenment
philosophers thought it was irrational to imagine a world without
God. The world was far too rational for that. Newton held the same
view, for example. It was also considered rational to believe in the
immortality of the soul. Just as for Descartes, whether or not man
has an immortal soul was held to be more a question of reason than of
faith.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That I find very strange. To
me, it&rsquo;s a typical case of what you believe, not of what you
know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t
live in the eighteenth century. According to the Enlightenment
philosophers, what religion needed was to be stripped of all the
irrational dogmas or doctrines that had got attached to the simple
teachings of Jesus during the course of ecclesiastical history.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Many people consequently
professed to what is known as Deism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;By Deism we mean a belief that
God created the world ages and ages ago, but has not revealed himself
to the world since. Thus God is reduced to the &lsquo;Supreme Being&rsquo;
who only reveals himself to mankind through nature and natural
laws, never in any &lsquo;supernatural&rsquo; way. We find a similar
&lsquo;philosophical God&rsquo; in the writings of Aristotle. For
him, God was the &lsquo;formal cause&rsquo; or &lsquo;first mover.&rsquo;
&ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So now there&rsquo;s only one
point left, human rights.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet this is perhaps the
most important. On the whole, you could say that the French
Enlightenment was more practical than the English philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You mean they lived according
to their philosophy?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, very much so. The French
Enlightenment philosophers did not content themselves with
theoretical views on man&rsquo;s place in society. They fought
actively for what they called the &lsquo;natural rights&rsquo; of the
citizen. At first, this took the form of a campaign against
censorship&mdash;for the freedom of the press. But also in matters of
religion, morals, and politics, the individual&rsquo;s right to
freedom of thought and utterance had to be secured. They also fought
for the abolition of slavery and for a more humane treatment of
criminals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I agree with most of
that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The principle of the
&lsquo;inviolability of the individual&rsquo; culminated in the
Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen adopted by the
French National Assembly in 178V. This Declaration of Human Rights
was the basis for our own Norwegian Constitution of 1814.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But a lot of people still have
to fight for these rights.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, unhappily. But the
Enlightenment philosophers wanted to establish certain rights that
everybody was entitled to simply by being born. That was what
they meant by natural rights.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We still speak of a &lsquo;natural
right&rsquo; which can often be in conflict with the laws of the
land. And we constantly find individuals, or even whole nations, that
claim this &lsquo;natural right&rsquo; when they rebel against
anarchy, servitude, and oppression.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What about women&rsquo;s
rights?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The French Revolution in 1787
established a number of rights for all &lsquo;citizens.&rsquo; But a
citizen was nearly always considered to be a man. Yet it was the
French Revolution that gave us the first inklings of feminism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was about time!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As early as 1787 the
Enlightenment philosopher Condorcet published a treatise on the
rights of women. He held that women had the same &lsquo;natural
rights&rsquo; as men. During the Revolution of 1789, women were
extremely active in the fight against the old feudal regime. For
example, it was women who led the demonstrations that forced the
king away from his palace at Versailles. Women&rsquo;s groups
were formed in Paris. In addition to the demand for the same
political rights as men, they also demanded changes in the marriage
laws and in women&rsquo;s social conditions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did they get equal rights?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No. Just as on so many
subsequent occasions, the question of women&rsquo;s rights was
exploited in the heat of the struggle, but as soon as things fell
into place in a new regime, the old male-dominated society was
re-introduced.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Typical!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;One of those who fought hardest
for the rights of women during the French Revolution was Olympe de
Gouges. In 1791&mdash;two years after the revolution&mdash;she
published a declaration on the rights of women. The declaration
on the rights of the citizen had not included any article on women&rsquo;s
natural rights. Olympe de Gouges now demanded all the same rights for
women as for men.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She was beheaded in 1793. And
all political activity for women was banned.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How shameful!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was not until the nineteenth
century that feminism really got under way, not only in France but
also in the rest of Europe. Little by little this struggle began to
bear fruit. But in Norway, for example, women did not get the right
to vote until 1913. And women in many parts of the world still have a
lot to fight for.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They can count on my support.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto sat looking across at the
lake. After a minute or two he said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was more or less what I
wanted to say about the Enlightenment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by more or
less?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have the feeling there won&rsquo;t
be any more.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
But as he said this, something began
to happen in the middle of the lake. Something was bubbling up from
the depths. A huge and hideous creature rose from the surface.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A sea serpent!&rdquo; cried
Sophie.</P>
<p>
The dark monster coiled itself back
and forth a few times and then disappeared back into the depths. The
water was as still as before.</P>
<p>
Alberto had turned away.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll go inside,&rdquo;
he said.</P>
<p>
They went into the little hut.</P>
<p>
Sophie stood looking at the two
pictures of Berkeley and Bjerkely. She pointed to the picture of
Bjerkely and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think Hilde lives somewhere
inside that picture.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
An embroidered sampler now hung
between the two pictures. It read: LIBERTY, EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY.</P>
<p>
Sophie turned to Alberto: &ldquo;Did
you hang that there?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He just shook his head with a
disconsolate expression.</P>
<p>
Then Sophie discovered a small
envelope on the mantelpiece. &ldquo;To Hilde and Sophie,&rdquo;
it said. Sophie knew at once who it was from, but it was a new turn
of events that he had begun to count on her.</P>
<p>
She opened the letter and read aloud:</P>
<p>
Dear both of you, Sophie&rsquo;s
philosophy teacher ought to have underlined the significance of the
French Enlightenment for the ideals and principles the UN is
founded on. Two hundred years ago, the slogan &ldquo;Liberty,
Equality, and Fraternity&rdquo; helped unite the people of
France. Today the same words should unite the whole world. It is more
important now than ever before to be one big Family of Man. Our
descendants are our own children and grandchildren. What kind of
world are they inheriting from us?</P>
<p>
Hilde&rsquo;s mother was calling from downstairs that the mystery was
starting in ten minutes and that she had put the pizza in the oven.
Hilde was quite exhausted after all she had read. She had been up
since six o&rsquo;clock this morning.</P>
<p>
She decided to spend the rest of the evening celebrating her
birthday with her mother. But first she had to look something up in
her encyclopedia.</P>
<p>
Gouges ... no. De Gouges? No again. Olympe de Gouges? Still a blank.
This encyclopedia had not written one single word about the woman who
was beheaded for her political commitment. Wasn&rsquo;t that
scandalous!</P>
<p>
She was surely not just someone her father had thought up?</P>
<p>
Hilde ran downstairs to get a bigger encyclopedia.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;I just have to look something up,&rdquo; she said to her
astounded mother.</P>
<p>
She took the FORV to GP volume of the big family encyclopedia and ran
up to her room again.</P>
<p>
Gouges ... there she was!</P>
<p>
Gouges, Marie Olympe (1748-1793), Fr. author, played a prominent role
during the French Revolution with numerous brochures on social
questions and several plays. One of the few during the Revolution
who campaigned for human rights to apply to women. In 1791 published
&ldquo;Declaration on the Rights of Women.&rdquo; Beheaded in 1793
for daring to defend Louis XVI and oppose Robespierre. (Lit: L.
Lacour, &ldquo;Les Origines du feminisme contem-porain,&rdquo; 1900)</P>
<br /><h3>Kant</h3><br />
<p>
...the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me...</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
It was close to midnight before Major Albert Knag called home to wish
Hilde a happy birthday. Hilde&rsquo;s mother answered the telephone.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you, Hilde.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dad.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you crazy? It&rsquo;s nearly midnight!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I just wanted to say Happy Birthday ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been doing that all day.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;... but I didn&rsquo;t want to call before the day was over.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get my present?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I did. Thank you very much.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to hear what you think of it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrific. I have hardly eaten all day, it&rsquo;s
so exciting.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have to know how far you&rsquo;ve gotten.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They just went inside the major&rsquo;s cabin because you
started teasing them with a sea serpent.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Enlightenment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And Olympe de Gouges.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So I didn&rsquo;t get it completely wrong.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Wrong in what way?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s one more birthday greeting to come. But
that one is set to music.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better read a little more before I go to sleep.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t given up, then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned more in this one day than ever before. I
can hardly believe that it&rsquo;s less than twenty-four hours since
Sophie got home from school and found the first envelope.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange how little time it takes to read.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help feeling sorry for her.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For Mom?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, for Sophie, of course.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The poor girl is totally confused.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s only ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You were going to say she&rsquo;s only made up.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, something like that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think Sophie and Alberto really exist.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk more about it when I get home.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Have a nice day.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I mean good night.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
When Hilde went to bed half an hour later it was still so light that
she could see the garden and the little bay. It never got really dark
at this time of the year.</P>
<p>
She played with the idea that she was inside a picture hanging on the
wall of the little cabin in the woods. She wondered if one could look
out of the picture into what surrounded it.</P>
<p>
Before she fell asleep, she read a few more pages in the big ring
binder.</P>
<p>
Sophie put the letter from Hilde&rsquo;s
father back on the mantel.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What he says about the UN is
not unimportant,&rdquo; said Alberto, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like
him interfering in my presentation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should
worry too much about that.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nevertheless, from now on I
intend to ignore all extraordinary phenomena such as sea
serpents and the like. Let&rsquo;s sit here by the window while I
tell you about Kant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie noticed a pair of glasses lying
on a small table between two armchairs. She also noticed that the
lenses were red.</P>
<p>
Maybe they were strong sunglasses . .
.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I have to be home before five. Mom has probably made
plans for my birthday.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That gives us three hours.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Immanuel Kant was born in 1724
in the East Prussian town of Konigsberg, the son of a master saddler.
He lived there practically all his life until he died at the age of
eighty. His family was deeply pious, and his own religious conviction
formed a significant background to his philosophy. Like
Berkeley, he felt it was essential to preserve the foundations of
Christian belief.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard enough about
Berkeley, thanks.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kant was the first of the
philosophers we have heard about so far to have taught philosophy at
a university. He was a professor of philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Professor?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There are two kinds of
philosopher. One is a person who seeks his own answers to
philosophical questions. The other is someone who is an expert on the
history of philosophy but does not necessarily construct his own
philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And Kant was that kind?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kant was both. If he had simply
been a brilliant professor and an expert on the ideas of other
philosophers, he would never have carved a place for himself in the
history of philosophy. But it is important to note that Kant had a
solid grounding in the philosophic tradition of the past. He was
familiar both with the rationalism of Descartes and Spinoza and
the empiricism of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I asked you not to mention
Berkeley again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember that the rationalists
believed that the basis for all human knowledge lay in the mind. And
that the empiricists believed all knowledge of the world proceeded
from the senses. Moreover, Hume had pointed out that there are clear
limits regarding which conclusions we could reach through our sense
perceptions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And who did Kant agree with?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He thought both views were
partly right, but he thought both were partly wrong, too. The
question everybody was concerned with was what we can know about
the world. This philosophical project had been preoccupying all
philosophers since Descartes.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Two main possibilities were
drawn up: either the world is exactly as we perceive it, or it is the
way it appears to our reason.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And what did Kant think?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kant thought that both
&lsquo;sensing&rsquo; and &lsquo;reason&rsquo; come into play in our
conception of the world. But he thought the rationalists went too far
in their claims as to how much reason can contribute, and he also
thought the empiricists placed too much emphasis on sensory
experience.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give me an
example soon, it will all be just a bunch of words.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In his point of departure Kant
agrees with Hume and the empiricists that all our knowledge of the
world comes from our sensations. But&mdash;and here Kant stretches
his hand out to the rationalists&mdash;in our reason there are also
decisive factors that determine how we perceive the world around us.
In other words, there are certain conditions in the human mind that
are contributive to our conception of the world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You call that an example?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us rather do a little
experiment. Could you bring those glasses from the table over there?
Thank you. Now, put them on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie put the glasses on. Everything
around her became red. The pale colors became pink and the dark
colors became crimson.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see exactly the same as
before, except that it&rsquo;s all red.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the
glasses limit the way you perceive reality. Everything you see is
part of the world around you, but how you see it is determined by the
glasses you are wearing. So you cannot say the world is red even
though you conceive it as being so.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;No, naturally.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you now took a walk in the
woods, or home to Captain&rsquo;s Bend, you would see everything
the way you normally do. But whatever you saw, it would all be
red.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As long as I didn&rsquo;t take
the glasses off, yes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that, Sophie, is precisely
what Kant meant when he said that there are certain conditions
governing the mind&rsquo;s operation which influence the way we
experience the world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What kind of conditions?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Whatever we see will first and
foremost be perceived as phenomena in time and space. Kant called
&lsquo;time&rsquo; and &lsquo;space&rsquo; our two &lsquo;forms of
intuition.&rsquo; And he emphasized that these two &lsquo;forms&rsquo;
in our own mind precede every experience. In other words, we can
know before we experience things that we will perceive them as
phenomena in time and space. For we are not able to take off the
&lsquo;glasses&rsquo; of reason.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he thought that perceiving
things in time and space was innate?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, in a way. What we see may
depend on whether we are raised in India or Greenland, but wherever
we are, we experience the world as a series of processes in time and
space. This is something we can say beforehand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t time and space
things that exist beyond ourselves?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No. Kant&rsquo;s idea was that
time and space belong to the human condition. Time and space are
first and foremost modes of perception and not attributes or the
physical world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was a whole new way of
looking at things.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For the mind of man is not just
&lsquo;passive wax&rsquo; which simply receives sensations from
outside. The mind leaves its imprint on the way we apprehend the
world. You could compare it with what happens when you pour water
into a glass pitcher. The water adapts itself to the pitcher&rsquo;s
form. In the same way our perceptions adapt themselves to our &lsquo;forms
of intuition.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I understand what you
mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kant claimed that it is not
only mind which conforms to things. Things also conform to the mind.
Kant called this the Copernican Revolution in the problem of human
knowledge.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;By that he meant that it was
just as new and just as radically different from former thinking as
when Copernicus claimed that the earth revolved around the sun
and not vice versa.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see now how he could think
both the rationalists and the empiricists were right up to a point.
The rationalists had almost forgotten the importance of experience,
and the empiricists had shut their eyes to the way our own mind
influences the way we see the world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And even the law of
causality&mdash;which Hume believed man could not experience&mdash;belongs
to the mind, according to Kant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Explain that, please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You remember how Hume claimed
that it was only force of habit that made us see a causal link behind
all natural processes. According to Hume, we cannot perceive the
black billiard ball as being the cause of the white ball&rsquo;s
movement. Therefore, we cannot prove that the black billiard ball
will always set the white one in motion.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But that very thing which Hume
says we cannot prove is what Kant makes into an attribute of human
reason. The law of causality is eternal and absolute simply because
human reason perceives everything that happens as a matter of cause
and effect.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Again, I would have thought
that the law of causality lay in the physical world itself, not in
our minds.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kant&rsquo;s philosophy states
that it is inherent in us. He agreed with Hume that we cannot know
with certainty what the world is like &lsquo;in itself.&rsquo; We can
only know what the world is like &lsquo;for me&rsquo;&mdash;or for
everybody. Kant&rsquo;s greatest contribution to philosophy is the
dividing line he draws between things in themselves&mdash;das Ding an
sich&mdash; and things as they appear to us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so good at
German.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kant made an important
distinction between &lsquo;the thing in itself and &lsquo;the thing
for me.&rsquo; We can never have certain knowledge of things &lsquo;in
themselves.&rsquo; We can only know how things &lsquo;appear&rsquo;
to us. On the other hand, prior to any particular experience we can
say something about how things will be perceived by the human mind.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We can?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Before you go out in the
morning, you cannot know what you will see or experience during the
day. But you can know that what you see and experience will be
perceived as happening in time and space. You can moreover
be confident that the law of cause and effect will apply, simply
because you carry it with you as part of your consciousness.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you mean we could have been
made differently?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we could have had a
different sensory apparatus. And we could have had a different sense
or time and a different feeling about space. We could even have been
created in such a way that we would not go around searching for the
cause of things that happen around us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Imagine there&rsquo;s a cat
lying on the floor in the living room. A ball comes rolling into the
room. What does the cat do?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried that lots of
times. The cat will run after the ball.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All right. Now imagine that you
were sitting in that same room. If you suddenly see a ball come
rolling in, would you also start running after it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;First, I would turn around to
see where the ball came from.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, because you are a human
being, you will inevitably look for the cause of every event,
because the law of causality is part of your makeup.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So Kant says.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume showed that we can neither
perceive nor prove natural laws. That made Kant uneasy. But he
believed he could prove their absolute validity by showing that in
reality we are talking about the laws of human cognition.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Will a child also turn around
to see where the ball came from?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe not. But Kant pointed out
that a child&rsquo;s reason is not fully developed until it has had
some sensory material to work with. It is altogether senseless to
talk about an empty mind.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, that would be a very
strange mind.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So now let&rsquo;s sum up.
According to Kant, there are two elements that contribute to man&rsquo;s
knowledge of the world. One is the external conditions that we cannot
know of before we have perceived them through the senses. We can call
this the material of knowledge. The other is the internal conditions
in man himself&mdash;such as the perception of events as happening in
time and space and as processes conforming to an unbreakable law
of causality. We can call this the form of knowledge.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto and Sophie remained seated for
a while gazing out of the window. Suddenly Sophie saw a little girl
between the trees on the opposite side of the lake.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Sophie.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The girl was only visible for a few
seconds, then she was gone. Sophie noticed that she was wearing some
kind of red hat.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We shall under no circumstances
let ourselves be distracted.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on, then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kant believed that there are
clear limits to what we can know. You could perhaps say that the
mind&rsquo;s &lsquo;glasses&rsquo; set these limits.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You remember that philosophers
before Kant had discussed the really &lsquo;big&rsquo;
questions&mdash;for instance, whether man has an immortal soul,
whether there is a God, whether nature consists of tiny indivisible
particles, and whether the universe is finite or infinite.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kant believed there was no
certain knowledge to be obtained on these questions. Not that he
rejected this type of argument. On the contrary. If he had just
brushed these questions aside, he could hardly have been called a
philosopher.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Be patient. In such great
philosophical questions, Kant believed that reason operates beyond
the limits of what we humans can comprehend. At the same time, there
is in our nature a basic desire to pose these same questions. But
when, for example, we ask whether the universe is finite or infinite,
we are asking about a totality of which we ourselves are a tiny part.
We can therefore never completely know this totality.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When you put the red glasses
on, we demonstrated that according to Kant there are two elements
that contribute to our knowledge of the world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sensory perception and reason.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, the material of our
knowledge comes to us through the senses, but this material must
conform to the attributes of reason. For example, one of the
attributes of reason is to seek the cause of an event.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like the ball rolling across
the floor.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you like. But when we wonder
where the world came from&mdash;and then discuss possible
answers&mdash;reason is in a sense &lsquo;on hold.&rsquo; For it has
no sensory material to process, no experience to make use of, because
we have never experienced the whole of the great reality that we are
a tiny part of.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We are&mdash;in a way&mdash;a
tiny part of the ball that comes rolling across the floor. So we
can&rsquo;t know where it came from.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it will always be an
attribute of human reason to ask where the ball comes from. That&rsquo;s
why we ask and ask, we exert ourselves to the fullest to find answers
to all the deepest questions. But we never get anything firm to bite
on; we never get a satisfactory answer because reason is not
locked on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I know exactly how that feels,
thank you very much.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In such weighty questions as to
the nature of reality, Kant showed that there will always be two
contrasting viewpoints that are equally likely or unlikely, depending
on what our reason tells us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Examples, please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is just as meaningful to say
that the world must have had a beginning in time as to say that it
had no such beginning. Reason cannot decide between them. We can
allege that the world has always existed, but con anything always
have existed if there was never any beginning? So now we are forced
to adopt the opposite view.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We say that the world must have
begun sometime&mdash; and it must have begun from nothing, unless we
want to talk about a change from one state to another. But can
something come from nothing, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, both possibilities are
equally problematic. Yet it seems one of them must be right and the
other wrong.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You probably remember that
Democritus and the materialists said that nature must consist of
minimal parts that everything is made up of. Others, like Descartes,
believed that it must always be possible to divide extended reality
into ever smaller parts. But which of them was right?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Both. Neither.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Further, many philosophers
named freedom as one of man&rsquo;s most important values. At the
same time we saw philosophers like the Stoics, for example, and
Spinoza, who said that everything happens through the necessity of
natural law. This was another case of human reason being unable to
make a certain judgment, according to Kant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Both views are equally
reasonable and unreasonable.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Finally, we are bound to fail
if we attempt to prove the existence of God with the aid of reason.
Here the rationalists, like Descartes, had tried to prove that there
must be a God simply because we have the idea of a &lsquo;supreme
being.&rsquo; Others, like Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, decided
that there must be a God because everything must have a first
cause.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What did Kant think?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He rejected both these proofs
of the existence of God. Neither reason nor experience is any certain
basis for claiming the existence of God. As far as reason goes, it is
just as likely as it is unlikely that God exists.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you started by saying that
Kant wanted to preserve the basis for Christian faith.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he opened up a religious
dimension. There, where both reason and experience fall short, there
occurs a vacuum that can be filled by faith.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he saved
Christianity?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;If you will. Now, it might be
worth noting that Kant was a Protestant. Since the days of the
Reformation, Protestantism has been characterized by its
emphasis on faith. The Catholic Church, on the other hand, has since
the early Middle Ages believed more in reason as a pillar of faith.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But Kant went further than
simply to establish that these weighty questions should be left to
the faith of the individual. He believed that it is essential
for morality to presuppose that man has an immortal soul, that
God exists, and that man has a free will.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he does the same as
Descartes. First he is very critical of everything we can understand.
And then he smuggles God in by the back door.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But unlike Descartes, he
emphasizes most particularly that it is not reason which brought him
to this point but faith. He himself called faith in the immortal
soul, in God&rsquo;s existence, and in man&rsquo;s free will
practical postulates.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Which means?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To &lsquo;postulate&rsquo;
something is to assume something that cannot be proved. By a
&lsquo;practical postulate,&rsquo; Kant meant something that had to
be assumed for the sake of &lsquo;praxis,&rsquo; or practice; that is
to say, for man&rsquo;s morality. &lsquo;It is a moral necessity to
assume the existence of God,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Suddenly there was a knock at the
door. Sophie got up, but as Alberto gave no sign of rising, she
asked: &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we see who it is?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto shrugged and reluctantly got
up. They opened the door, and a little girl stood there in a white
summer dress and a red bonnet. It was the girl they had seen on the
other side of the lake. Over one arm she carried a basket of food.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; said Sophie. &ldquo;Who
are you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see I am Little
Red Ridinghood?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie looked at Alberto, and Alberto
nodded.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You heard what she said.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for my
grandmother&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;She is old
and sick, but I&rsquo;m taking her some food.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo;
said Alberto, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;d better get on your way.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He gestured in a way that reminded
Sophie of the way you brush off a fly.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m supposed to
deliver a letter,&rdquo; continued the girl in the red bonnet.</P>
<p>
With that, she took out a small
envelope and handed it to Sophie. Then she went skipping away.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Watch out for the wolf!&rdquo;
Sophie called after her.</P>
<p>
Alberto was already on his way back
into the living room.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Just think! That was Little Red
Ridinghood,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s no good warning
her. She will go to her grandmother&rsquo;s house and be eaten by the
wolf. She never learns. It will repeat itself to the end of time &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I have never heard that she
knocked on the door of another house before she went to her
grandmother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A bagatelle, Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Now Sophie looked at the envelope she
had been given. It was addressed &ldquo;To Hilde.&rdquo; She opened
it and read aloud:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, If the human brain was
simple enough for us to understand, we would still be so stupid that
we couldn&rsquo;t understand it. Love, Dad.</P>
<p>
Alberto nodded. &ldquo;True enough. I
believe Kant said something to that effect. We cannot expect to
understand what we are. Maybe we can comprehend a flower or an
insect, but we can never comprehend ourselves. Even less can we
expect to comprehend the universe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie had to read the cryptic
sentence in the note to Hilde several times before Alberto went on:
&ldquo;We are not going to be interrupted by sea serpents and the
like. Before we stop for today, I&rsquo;ll tell you about Kant&rsquo;s
ethics.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Please hurry. I have to go home
soon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hume&rsquo;s skepticism with
regard to what reason and the senses can tell us forced Kant to think
through many of life&rsquo;s important questions again. Not least in
the area of ethics.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Hume say that you
can never prove what is right and what is wrong2 You can&rsquo;t draw
conclusions from is - sentence? to ought-sentences.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For Hume it was neither our
reason nor our experience that determined the difference between
right and wrong. It was simply our sentiments. This was too tenuous a
basis for Kant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can imagine.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kant had always felt that the
difference between right and wrong was a matter of reason, not
sentiment. In this he agreed with the rationalists, who said the
ability to distinguish between right and wrong is inherent in human
reason. Everybody knows what is right or wrong, not because we
have learned it but because it is born in the mind. According to
Kant, everybody has &lsquo;practical reason,&rsquo; that is, the
intelligence that gives us the capacity to discern what is right or
wrong in every case.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that is innate?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The ability to tell right from
wrong is just as innate as all the other attributes of reason. Just
as we are all intelligent beings, for example, perceiving
everything as having a causal relation, we all have access to the
same universal moral law.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This moral law has the same
absolute validity as the physical laws. It is just as basic to our
morality as the statements that everything has a cause, or that seven
plus five is twelve, are basic to our intelligence.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And what does that moral law
say?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Since it precedes every
experience, it is &lsquo;formal.&rsquo; That is to say, it is not
bound to any particular situation of moral choice. For it applies to
all people in all societies at all times. So it does not say you
shall do this or this if you find yourself in that or that situation.
It says how you are to behave in all situations.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But what is the point of having
a moral law implanted inside yourself if it doesn&rsquo;t tell you
what to do in specific situations?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kant formulates the moral law
as a categorical imperative. By this he means that the moral law
is &lsquo;categorical,&rsquo; or that it applies to all situations.
It is, moreover, &lsquo;imperative,&rsquo; which means it is
commanding and therefore absolutely authoritative.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Kant formulates this
&lsquo;categorical imperative&rsquo; in several ways. First he says:
Act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a
Universal Law of Nature.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So when I do something, I must
make sure I want everybody else to do the same if they are in the
same situation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. Only then will you be
acting in accordance with the moral law within you. Kant also
formulates the &lsquo;categorical imperative&rsquo; in this way: Act
in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own
person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means,
but always at the same time as an end.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So we must not exploit other
people to our own advantage.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, because every man is an end
in himself. But that does not only apply to others, it also applies
to you yourself. You must not exploit yourself as a mere means
to achieving something, either.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It reminds me of the golden
rule: Do unto others . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that is also a &lsquo;formal&rsquo;
rule of conduct that basically covers all ethical choices. You
could say that the golden rule says the same thing as Kant&rsquo;s
universal law of morals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But surely this is only an
assertion. Hume was probably right in that we can&rsquo;t prove
what is right or wrong by reason.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;According to Kant, the law of
morals is just as absolute and just as universal as the law of
causality. That cannot be proved by reason either, but it is
nevertheless absolute and unalterable. Nobody would deny that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I get the feeling that what we
are really talking about is conscience. Because everybody has a
conscience, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. When Kant describes the
law of morals, he is describing the human conscience. We cannot prove
what our conscience tells us, but we know it, nevertheless.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sometimes I might only be kind
and helpful to others because I know it pays off. It could be a way
of becoming popular.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But if you share with others
only to be popular, you are not acting out of respect for moral law.
You might be acting in accordance with moral law&mdash;and that could
be fair enough&mdash;but if it is to be a moral action, you must have
conquered yourself. Only when you do something purely out of duty can
it be called a moral action. Kant&rsquo;s ethics is therefore
sometimes called duty ethics.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can feel it my duty to
collect money for the Red Cross or the church bazaar.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and the important thing is
that you do it because you know it is right. Even if the money you
collect gets lost in the street, or is not sufficient to feed all the
mouths it is intended to, you obeyed the moral law. You acted out of
good will, and according to Kant, it is this good will which
determines whether or not the action was morally right, not the
consequences of the action. Kant&rsquo;s ethics is therefore also
called a good will ethic.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why was it so important to him
to know exactly when one acts out of respect for moral law? Surely
the most important thing is that what we do really helps other
peo-pie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed it is and Kant would
certainly not disagree. But only when we know in ourselves that we
are acting out of respect for moral law are we acting freely.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We act freely only when we obey
a law? Isn&rsquo;t that kind of peculiar?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not according to Kant. You
perhaps remember that he had to &lsquo;assume&rsquo;or &lsquo;postulate&rsquo;
that man has a free will. This is an important point, because Kant
also said that everything obeys the law of causality. How, then, can
we have a free will?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Search me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;On this point Kant divides man
into two parts in a way not dissimilar to the way Descartes claimed
that man was a &lsquo;dual creature,&rsquo; one with both a body and
a mind. As material creatures, we are wholly and fully at the mercy
of causality&rsquo;s unbreakable law, says Kant. We do not decide
what we perceive&mdash;perception comes to us through necessity and
influences us whether we like it or not. But we are not only material
creatures&mdash;we are also creatures of reason.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As material beings we belong
wholly to the natural world. We are therefore subject to causal
relations. As such, we have no free will. But as rational beings we
have a part in what Kant calls das Ding an sich&mdash;that is, the
world as it exists in itself, independent of our sensory
impressions. Only when we follow our &lsquo;practical reason&rsquo;&mdash;
which enables us to make moral choices&mdash;do we exercise our free
will, because when we conform to moral law, it is we who make the law
we are conforming to.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true in a
way. It is me, or something in me, which tells me not to be mean to
others.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So when you choose not to be
mean&mdash;even if it is against your own interests&mdash;you are
then acting freely.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not especially
free or independent if you just do whatever you want, in any case.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;One can become a slave to all
kinds of things. One can even become a slave to one&rsquo;s own
egoism. Independence and freedom are exactly what are required
to rise above one&rsquo;s desires and vices.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What about animals? I suppose
they just follow their inclinations and needs. They don&rsquo;t have
any freedom to follow moral law, do they?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s the difference
between animals and humans.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see that now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And finally we could perhaps
say that Kant succeeded in showing the way out of the impasse that
philosophy had reached in the struggle between rationalism and
empiricism. With Kant, an era in the history of philosophy is
therefore at an end. He died in 1804, when the cultural epoch we call
Romanticism was in the ascendant. One of his most quoted sayings is
carved on his gravestone in Konigsberg: Two things fill my mind with
ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely
the reflection dwells on them: the starry heavens above me and the
moral law within me.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto leaned back in his chair.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think I have told
you what&rsquo;s most important about Kant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s a quarter
past four.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But there is just one thing.
Please give me a minute.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;I never leave the classroom
before the teacher is finished.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did I say that Kant believed we
had no freedom if we lived only as creatures of the senses?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you said something like
that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But if we obey universal reason
we are free and independent. Did I say that, too?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Why are you saying it
again now?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto leaned toward Sophie, looked
deep into her eyes, and whispered: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe
everything you see, Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Just turn the other way,
child.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t understand
what you mean at all.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;People usually say, I&rsquo;ll
believe that when I see it. But don&rsquo;t believe what you see,
either.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You said something like that
once before.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, about Parmenides.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I still don&rsquo;t know
what you mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, we sat out there on the
step, talking. Then that so-called sea serpent began to flap about in
the water.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it peculiar!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not at all. Then Little Red
Ridinghood came to the door. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m looking for my
grandmother&rsquo;s house.&rsquo; What a silly performance! It&rsquo;s
just the major&rsquo;s tricks, Sophie. Like the banana message and
that idiotic thunderstorm.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you think ... ?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I said I had a plan. As
long as we stick to our reason, he can&rsquo;t trick us. Because in a
way we are free. He can let us &lsquo;perceive&rsquo; all kinds of
things; nothing would surprise me. If he lets the sky go dark or
elephants fly, I shall only smile. But seven plus five is twelve.
That&rsquo;s a fact that survives all his comic-strip effects.
Philosophy is the opposite of fairy tales.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie sat for a moment staring at him
in amazement.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Off you go,&rdquo; he said
finally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you for a session on Romanticism. You
also need to hear about Hegel and Kierkegaard. But there&rsquo;s only
a week to go before the major arrives at Kjevik airport. Before then,
we must manage to free ourselves from his gluey fantasies. I&rsquo;ll
say no more, Sophie. Except that I want you to know I&rsquo;m working
on a wonderful plan for both of us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be off, then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Wait&mdash;we may have
forgotten the most important thing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The birthday song, Sophie.
Hilde is fifteen today.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are, too, yes. Let&rsquo;s
sing then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They both stood up and sang:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Happy Birthday to You.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
It was half-past four. Sophie ran down
to the water&rsquo;s edge and rowed over to the other side. She
pulled the boat up into the rushes and began to hurry through the
woods.</P>
<p>
When she reached the path, she
suddenly noticed something moving between the trees. She wondered if
it was Little Red Ridinghood wandering alone through the woods to her
grandmother&rsquo;s, but the figure between the trees was much
smaller.</P>
<p>
She went nearer. The figure was no
bigger than a doll. It was brown and was wearing a red sweater.</P>
<p>
Sophie stopped dead in her tracks when
she realized it was a teddy bear.</P>
<p>
That someone could have left a teddy
bear in the forest was in itself no surprise. But this teddy bear was
alive, and seemed intensely preoccupied.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;My name is Winnie-the-Pooh,&rdquo;
said the teddy bear, &ldquo;and I have unfortunately lost my way in
the woods on this otherwise very fine day. I have certainly never
seen you before.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m the one who has
never been here before,&rdquo; said Sophie. &ldquo;So for that matter
you could still be back home in Hundred Acre Wood.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, that sum is much too hard.
Don&rsquo;t forget I&rsquo;m only a small bear and I&rsquo;m not very
clever.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have heard of you.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And I suppose you are Alice.
Christopher Robin told us about you one day. I suppose that&rsquo;s
how we met. You drank so much out of one bottle that you got smaller
and smaller. But then you drank out of another bottle and started to
grow again. You really have to be careful what you put in your mouth.
I ate so much once that I got stuck in a rabbit hole.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not Alice.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It makes no difference who we
are. The important thing is that we are. That&rsquo;s what Owl says,
and he is very wise. Seven plus four is twelve, he once said on quite
an ordinary sunny day. Both Eeyore and me felt very stupid, &lsquo;cos
it&rsquo;s hard to do sums. It&rsquo;s much easier to figure out the
weather.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;My name is Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nice to meet you, Sophie. As I
said, I think you must be new around here. But now this little bear
has to go &lsquo;cos I&rsquo;ve got to find Piglet. We are going to a
great big garden party for Rabbit and his friends.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He waved with one paw. Sophie saw now
that he was holding a little folded piece of paper in the other.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is that you&rsquo;ve got
there?&rdquo; she asked.</P>
<p>
Winnie-the-Pooh produced the paper and
said: &ldquo;This was what made me lose my way.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only a piece of
paper.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s not only a piece
of paper. It&rsquo;s a letter to Hilde-through-the-Looking-Glass.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I can take that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you the girl in the looking
glass?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, but. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A letter must always be
delivered personally. Christopher Robin had to teach me that
only yesterday.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I know Hilde.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Makes no difference. Even if
you know a person very well, you should never read their letters.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I mean, I can give it to
Hilde.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a different
thing. Here you are, Sophie. If I can get rid of this letter, I can
probably find Piglet as well. To find
Hilde-through-the-Looking-Glassyou must first find a big looking
glass. But that is no easy matter round here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
And with that the little bear handed
over the folded paper to Sophie and set off through the woods on his
little feet. When he was out of sight, Sophie unfolded the piece of
paper and read it:</P>
<p>
Dear Hilde, It&rsquo;s too bad that
Alberto didn&rsquo;t also tell Sophie that Kant advocated the
establishment of a &ldquo;league of nations.&rdquo; In his treatise
Perpetual Peace, he wrote that all countries should unite in a league
of the nations, which would assure peaceful coexistence between
nations. About 125 years after the appearance of this treatise
in 1795, the League of Nations was founded, after the First World
War. After the Second World War it was replaced by the United
Nations. So you could say that Kant was the father of the UN idea.
Kant&rsquo;s point was that man&rsquo;s &ldquo;practical reason&rdquo;
requires the nations to emerge from their wild state of nature which
creates wars, and contract to keep the peace. Although the road to
the establishment of a league of nations is laborious, it is our
duty to work for the &ldquo;universal and lasting securing of
peace.&rdquo; The establishment of such a league was for Kant a
far-distant goal. You could almost say it was philosophy&rsquo;s
ultimate goal. I am in Lebanon at the moment. Love, Dad.</P>
<p>
Sophie put the note in her pocket and
continued on her way homeward. This was the kind of meeting in the
woods Alberto had warned her about. But she couldn&rsquo;t have let
the little teddy wander about in the woods on a never ending hunt for
Hilde-through-the-Looking-Glass, could she?</P>
<br /><h3>Romanticism</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;the path of mystery leads inwards&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Hilde let the heavy ring binder slide into her lap. Then she let it
slide further onto the floor.</P>
<p>
It was already lighter in the room than when she had gone to bed. She
looked at the clock. It was almost three. She snuggled down under the
covers and closed her eyes. As she was falling asleep she wondered
why her father had begun to write about Little Red Ridinghood and
Winnie-the-Pooh ...</P>
<p>
She slept until eleven o&rsquo;clock the next morning. The tension in
her body told her that she had dreamed intensely all night, but
she could not remember what she had dreamed. It felt as if she had
been in a totally different reality.</P>
<p>
She went downstairs and fixed breakfast. Her mother had put on her
blue jumpsuit ready to go down to the boathouse and work on the
motorboat. Even if it was not afloat, it had to be shipshape when Dad
got back from Lebanon.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you want to come down and give me a hand?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have to read a little first. Should I come down with some
tea and a mid-morning snack?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What mid-morning?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
When Hilde had eaten she went back up to her room, made her bed, and
sat herself comfortably with the ring binder resting against her
knees.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
*        *        *</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie slipped through the hedge and
stood in the big garden which she had once thought of as her own
Garden of Eden . . .</P>
<p>
There were branches and leaves strewn
everywhere after the storm the night before. It seemed to her
that there was some connection between the storm and the fallen
branches and her meeting with Little Red Ridinghood and
Winnie-the-Pooh.</P>
<p>
She went into the house. Her mother
had just gotten home and was putting some bottles of soda in the
refrigerator. On the table was a delicious-looking chocolate
cake.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you expecting visitors?&rdquo;
asked Sophie; she had almost forgotten it was her birthday.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having the real
party next Saturday, but I thought we ought to have a little
celebration today as well.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have invited Joanna and her
parents.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Fine with me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The visitors arrived shortly before
half-past seven. The atmosphere was somewhat formal&mdash;Sophie&rsquo;s
mother very seldom saw Joanna&rsquo;s parents socially.</P>
<p>
It was not long before Sophie and
Joanna went upstairs to Sophie&rsquo;s room to write the garden party
invitations. Since Alberto Knox was also to be invited, Sophie had
the idea of inviting people to a &ldquo;philosophical garden party.&rdquo;
Joanna didn&rsquo;t object. It was Sophie&rsquo;s party after all,
and theme parties were &ldquo;in&rdquo; at the moment.</P>
<p>
Finally they had composed the
invitation. It had taken two hours and they couldn&rsquo;t stop
laughing.</P>
<p>
Dear. . .</P>
<p>
You are hereby invited to a
philosophical garden party at 3 Clover Close on Saturday June 23
(Midsummer Eve) at 7 p.m. During the evening we shall hopefully
solve the mystery of life. Please bring warm sweaters and bright
ideas suitable for solving the riddles of philosophy. Because of
the danger of woodland fires we unfortunately cannot have a
bonfire, but everybody is free to let the flames of their imagination
flicker unimpeded. There will be at least one genuine philosopher
among the invited guests. For this reason the party is a strictly
private arrangement. Members of the press will not be admitted. With
regards,</P>
<p>
Joanna Ingebrigtsen (organizing
committee)</P>
<p>
and Sophie Amundsen (hostess)</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
The two girls went downstairs to their
parents, who were now talking somewhat more freely. Sophie handed the
draft invitation, written with a calligraphic pen, to her mother.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Could you make eighteen copies,
please.&rdquo; It was not the first time she had asked her mother to
make photocopies for her at work.</P>
<p>
Her mother read the invitation and
then handed it to Joanna&rsquo;s father.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You see what I mean? She is
going a little crazy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it looks really exciting,&rdquo;
said Joanna&rsquo;s father, handing the sheet on to his wife. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t mind coming to that party myself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Barbie read the invitation, then she
said: &ldquo;Well, I must say! Can we come too, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say twenty copies,
then,&rdquo; said Sophie, taking them at their word.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You must be nuts!&rdquo; said
Joanna.</P>
<p>
Before Sophie went to bed that night
she stood for a long time gazing out of the window. She remembered
how she had once seen the outline of Alberto&rsquo;s figure in the
darkness. It was more than a month ago. Now it was again late at
night, but this was a white summer night.</P>
<p>
Sophie heard nothing from Alberto
until Tuesday morning. He called just after her mother had left for
work.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sophie Amundsen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And Alberto Knox.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t
call before, but I&rsquo;ve been working hard on our plan. I can only
be alone and work undisturbed when the major is concentrating
wholly and completely on you.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I seize the opportunity to
conceal myself, you see. The best surveillance system in the world
has its limitations when it is only controlled by one single
person ... I got your card.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You mean the invitation?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Dare you risk it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Anything can happen at a party
like that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m coming. But
there is another thing. Did you remember that it&rsquo;s the day
Hilde&rsquo;s father gets back from Lebanon?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t, actually.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t possibly be pure
coincidence that he lets you arrange a philosophical garden party the
same day as he gets home to Bjerkely.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think about it,
as I said.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he did. But all
right, we&rsquo;ll talk about that later. Can you come to the major&rsquo;s
cabin this morning?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to weed the
flower beds.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say two o&rsquo;clock,
then. Can you make that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto Knox was sitting on the step
again when Sophie arrived.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Have a seat,&rdquo; he said,
getting straight down to work.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Previously we spoke of the
Renaissance, the Baroque period, and the Enlightenment. Today we are
going to talk about Romanticism, which could be described as
Europe&rsquo;s last great cultural epoch. We are approaching the
end of a long story, my child.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did Romanticism last that
long?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It began toward the end of the
eighteenth century and lasted till the middle of the nineteenth. But
after 1850 one can no longer speak of whole &lsquo;epochs&rsquo;
which comprise poetry, philosophy, art, science, and music.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was Romanticism one of those
epochs?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It has been said that
Romanticism was Europe&rsquo;s last common approach to life. It
started in Germany, arising as a reaction to the Enlightenment&rsquo;s
unequivocal emphasis on reason. After Kant and his cool
intellectualism, it was as if German youth heaved a sigh of relief.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What did they replace it with?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The new catchwords were
&lsquo;feeling,&rdquo;imagination,&rdquo;experience,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;yearning.&rsquo; Some of the Enlightenment thinkers had drawn
attention to the importance of feeling&mdash;not least
Rousseau&mdash;but at that time it was a criticism of the bias toward
reason. What had been an undercurrent now became the mainstream
of German culture.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So Kant&rsquo;s popularity
didn&rsquo;t last very long?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it did and it didn&rsquo;t.
Many of the Romantics saw themselves as Kant&rsquo;s successors,
since Kant had established that there was a limit to what we can
know of &lsquo;das Ding an sich.&rsquo; On the other hand, he had
underlined the importance of the ego&rsquo;s contribution to
knowledge, or cognition. The individual was now completely free to
interpret life in his own way. The Romantics exploited this in
an almost unrestrained &lsquo;ego-worship,&rsquo; which led to the
exaltation of artistic genius.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Were there a lot of these
geniuses?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Beethoven was one. His music
expresses his own feelings and yearnings. Beethoven was in a
sense a &lsquo;free&rsquo; artist&mdash;unlike the Baroque masters
such as Bach and Handel, who composed their works to the glory of
God, mostly in strict musical forms.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I only know the Moonlight
Sonata and the Fifth Symphony.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you know how romantic the
Moonlight Sonata is, and you can hear how dramatically Beethoven
expresses himself in the Fifth Symphony.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You said the Renaissance
humanists were individualists too.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. There were many
similarities between the Renaissance and Romanticism. A typical
one was the importance of art to human cognition. Kant made a
considerable contribution here as well. In his aesthetics he
investigated what happens when we are overwhelmed by beauty&mdash;in
a work of art, for instance. When we abandon ourselves to a work
of art with no other intention than the aesthetic experience itself,
we are brought closer to an experience of &lsquo;das Ding an sich.&rsquo;
&ldquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;So the artist can provide
something philosophers can&rsquo;t express?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was the view of the
Romantics. According to Kant, the artist plays freely on his faculty
of cognition. The German poet Schiller developed Kant&rsquo;s thought
further. He wrote that the activity of the artist is like playing,
and man is only free when he plays, because then he makes up his own
rules. The Romantics believed that only art could bring us closer to
&lsquo;the inexpressible.&rsquo; Some went as far as to compare the
artist to God.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because the artist creates his
own reality the way God created the world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was said that the artist had
a &lsquo;universe-creating imagination.&rsquo; In his transports of
artistic rapture he could sense the dissolving of the boundary
between dream and reality.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Novalis, one of the young
geniuses, said that &lsquo;the world becomes a dream, and the dream
becomes reality.&rsquo; He wrote a novel called Heinrich von
Ofterdingen set in Medieval times. It was unfinished when he died in
1801, but it was nevertheless a very significant novel. It tells of
the young Heinrich who is searching for the &lsquo;blue flower&rsquo;
that he once saw in a dream and has yearned for ever since. The
English Romantic poet Coleridge expressed the same idea; saying
something like this:</P>
<p>
What if you slept? And what if, in
your sleep, you dreamed? And what if, in your dream, you went to
heaven and there plucked a strange and beautiful flower? And what if,
when you awoke, you had the flower in your hand? Ah, what then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How pretty!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This yearning for something
distant and unattainable was characteristic of the Romantics. They
longed for bygone eras, such as the Middle Ages, which now
became enthusiastically reappraised after the Enlightenment&rsquo;s
negative evaluation. And they longed for distant cultures like
the Orient with its mysticism. Or else they would feel drawn to
Night, to Twilight, to old ruins and the supernatural. They were
preoccupied with what we usually refer to as the dark side of life,
or the murky, uncanny, and mystical.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It sounds to me like an
exciting period. Who were these Romantics?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Romanticism was in the main an
urban phenomenon. In the first half of the last century there was, in
fact, a flourishing metropolitan culture in many parts of Europe, not
least in Germany. The typical Romantics were young men, often
university students, although they did not always take their
studies very seriously. They had a decidedly anti-middle class
approach to life and could refer to the police or their landladies as
philistines, for example, or simply as the enemy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I would never have dared rent a
room to a Romantic!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The first generation of
Romantics were young in about 1 800, and we could actually call the
Romantic Movement Europe&rsquo;s first student uprising. The
Romantics were not unlike the hippies a hundred and fifty years
later.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You mean flower power and long
hair, strumming their guitars and lying around?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. It was once said that
&lsquo;idleness is the ideal of genius, and indolence the virtue
of the Romantic.&rsquo; It was the duty of the Romantic to experience
life&mdash;or to dream himself away from it. Day-to-day business
could be taken care of by the philistines.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Byron was a Romantic poet,
wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, both Byron and Shelley
were Romantic poets of the so-called Satanic school. Byron, moreover,
provided the Romantic Age with its idol, the Byronic hero&mdash;the
alien, moody, rebellious spirit&mdash;in life as well as in art.
Byron himself could be both willful and passionate, and being also
handsome, he was besieged by women of fashion. Public gossip
attributed the romantic adventures of his verses to his own life, but
although he had numerous liaisons, true love remained as illusive and
as unattainable for him as Novalis&rsquo;s blue flower. Novalis
became engaged to a fourteen-year-old girl. She died four days
after her fifteenth birthday, but Novalis remained devoted to her for
the rest of his short life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you say she died four days
after her fifteenth birthday?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Yes . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am fifteen years and four
days old today.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So you are.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What was her name?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Her name was Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it was. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You scare me. Could it be a
coincidence?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say, Sophie.
But her name was Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Novalis himself died when he
was only twenty-nine. He was one of the &lsquo;y&deg;un9 dead.&rsquo;
Many of the Romantics died young, usually of tuberculosis. Some
committed suicide . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Those who lived to be old
usually stopped being Romantics at about the age of thirty. Some
of them went on to become thoroughly middle-class and conservative.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They went over to the enemy,
then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe. But we were talking
about romantic love. The theme of unrequited love was introduced as
early as 1774 by Goethe in his novel The Sorrows of Young Werther.
The book ends with young Werther shooting himself when he can&rsquo;t
have the woman he loves . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was it necessary to go that
far?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The suicide rate rose after the
publication of the novel, and for a time the book was banned in
Denmark and Norway. So being a Romantic was not without danger.
Strong emotions were involved.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When you say &lsquo;Romantic/ I
think of those great big landscape paintings, with dark forests and
wild, rugged nature ... preferably in swirling mists.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, one of the features of
Romanticism was this yearning for nature and nature&rsquo;s
mysteries. And as I said, it was not the kind of thing that arises in
rural areas. You may recall Rousseau, who initiated the slogan
&lsquo;back to nature.&rsquo; The Romantics gave this slogan popular
currency. Romanticism represents not least a reaction to the
Enlightenment&rsquo;s mechanistic universe. It was said that
Romanticism implied a renaissance of the old cosmic consciousness.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Explain that, please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;It means viewing nature as a
whole; the Romantics were tracing their roots not only back to
Spinoza, but also to Plotinus and Renaissance philosophers like Jakob
Bohme and Giordano Bruno. What all these thinkers had in common was
that they experienced a divine &lsquo;ego&rsquo; in nature.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They were Pantheists then . .
.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Both Descartes and Hume had
drawn a sharp line between the ego and &lsquo;extended&rsquo;
reality. Kant had also left behind him a sharp distinction between
the cognitive &lsquo;I&rsquo; and nature &lsquo;in itself.&rsquo; Now
it was said that nature is nothing but one big &lsquo;I.&rsquo;
The Romantics also used the expressions &lsquo;world soul&rsquo;
or &lsquo;world spirit.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The leading Romantic
philosopher was Schelling, who lived from 1775 to 1854. He wanted to
unite mind and matter. All of nature&mdash;both the human soul and
physical reality&mdash;is the expression of one Absolute, or world
spirit, he believed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, just like Spinoza.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nature is visible spirit,
spirit is invisible nature, said Schelling, since one senses a
&lsquo;structuring spirit&rsquo; everywhere in nature. He also
said that matter is slumbering intelligence.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to explain
that a bit more clearly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Schelling saw a &lsquo;world
spirit&rsquo; in nature, but he saw the same &lsquo;world spirit&rsquo;
in the human mind. The natural and the spiritual are actually
expressions of the same thing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, why not?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;World spirit can thus be sought
both in nature and in one&rsquo;s own mind. Novalis could therefore
say &lsquo;the path of mystery leads inwards.&rsquo; He was saying
that man bears the whole universe within himself and comes closest to
the mystery of the world by stepping inside himself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very lovely
thought.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For many Romantics, philosophy,
nature study, and poetry formed a synthesis. Sitting in your attic
dashing off inspired verses and investigating the life of plants or
the composition of rocks were only two sides of the same coin because
nature is not a dead mechanism, it is one living world spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Another word and I think I&rsquo;ll
become a Romantic.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Norwegian-born naturalist
Henrik Steffens&mdash;whom Wergeland called &lsquo;Norway&rsquo;s
departed laurel leaf because he had settled in Germany&mdash;went
to Copenhagen in 1801 to lecture on German Romanticism. He
characterized the Romantic Movement by saying, &lsquo;Tired of
the eternal efforts to fight our way through raw matter, we
chose another way and sought to embrace the infinite. We went inside
ourselves and created a new world ... &lsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How can you remember all that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A bagatelle, child.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on, then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Schelling also saw a
development in nature from earth and rock to the human mind. He drew
attention to very gradual transitions from inanimate nature to more
complicated life forms. It was characteristic of the Romantic
view in general that nature was thought of as an organism, or in
other words, a unity which is constantly developing its innate
potentialities. Nature is like a flower unfolding its leaves and
petals. Or like a poet unfolding his verses.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that remind you
of Aristotle?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It does indeed. The Romantic
natural philosophy had Aristotelian as well as Neoplatonic overtones.
Aristotle had a more organic view of natural processes than the
mechanical materialists . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I
thought. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We find similar ideas at work
in the field of history. A man who came to have great significance
for the Romantics was the historical philosopher Johann
Gottfried von Herder, who lived from 1744 to 1803. He believed that
history is characterized by continuity, evolution, and design. We say
he had a &lsquo;dynamic&rsquo; view of history because he saw it
as a process. The Enlightenment philosophers had often had a
&lsquo;static&rsquo; view of history. To them, there was only one
universal reason which there could be more or less of at various
periods. Herder showed that each historical epoch had its own
intrinsic value and each nation its own character or &lsquo;soul.&rsquo;
The question is whether we can identify with other cultures.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So, just as we have to identify
with another person&rsquo;s Situation to understand them better, we
have to identify with other cultures to understand them too.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is taken for granted
nowadays. But in the Romantic period it was a new idea.
Romanticism helped strengthen the feeling of national identity. It is
no coincidence that the Norwegian struggle for national
independence flourished at that particular time&mdash;in 1814.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because Romanticism involved
new orientations in so many areas, it has been usual to distinguish
between two forms of Romanticism. There is what we call Universal
Romanticism, referring to the Romantics who were preoccupied
with nature, world soul, and artistic genius. This form of
Romanticism flourished first, especially around 1800, in Germany, in
the town of Jena.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The other is the so-called
National Romanticism, which became popular a little later, especially
in the town of Heidelberg. The National Romantics were mainly
interested in the history of &lsquo;the people,&rsquo; the
language of &lsquo;the people,&rsquo; and the culture of &lsquo;the
people&rsquo; in general. And &lsquo;the people&rsquo; were seen as
an organism unfolding its innate potentiality&mdash;exactly like
nature and history.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me where you live, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you who you are.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What united these two aspects
of Romanticism was first and foremost the key word &lsquo;organism.&rsquo;
The Romantics considered both a plant and a nation to be a living
organism. A poetic work was also a living organism. Language
was an organism. The entire physical world, even, was considered one
organism. There is therefore no sharp dividing line between National
Romanticism and Universal Romanticism. The world spirit was just
as much present in the people and in popular culture as in nature and
art.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Herder had been the forerunner,
collecting folk songs from many lands under the eloquent title Voices
of the People. He even referred to folktales as &lsquo;the mother
tongue of the people.&rsquo; The Brothers Grimm and others began to
collect folk songs and fairy tales in Heidelberg. You must know of
Grimm&rsquo;s Fairy Tales.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh sure, Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs, Rumpelstiltskin, The Frog Prince, Hansel and Gretel . .
.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;And many more. In Norway we
had Asbj0rnsen and Moe, who traveled around the country collecting
&lsquo;folks&rsquo; own tales.&rsquo; It was like harvesting a juicy
fruit that was suddenly discovered to be both good and nourishing.
And it was urgent&mdash;the fruit had already begun to fall. Folk
songs were collected; the Norwegian language began to be studied
scientifically. The old myths and sagas from heathen times were
rediscovered, and composers all over Europe began to incorporate folk
melodies into their compositions in an attempt to bridge the gap
between folk music and art music.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s art music?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Art music is music composed by
a particular person, like Beethoven. Folk music was not written by
any particular person, it came from the people. That&rsquo;s why
we don&rsquo;t know exactly when the various folk melodies date from.
We distinguish in the same way between folktales and art tales.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So art tales are ... ?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They are tales written by an
author, like Hans Christian Andersen. The fairy tale genre was
passionately cultivated by the Romantics. One of the German
masters of the genre was E.T.A, Hoffmann.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of The Tales
of Hoffmann.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The fairy tale was the absolute
literary ideal of the Romantics&mdash;in the same way that the
absolute art form of the Baroque period was the theater. It gave the
poet full scope to explore his own creativity.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He could play God to a
fictional universe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Precisely. And this is a good
moment to sum up.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The philosophers of Romanticism
viewed the &lsquo;world soul&rsquo; as an &lsquo;ego&rsquo; which in
a more or less dreamlike state created everything in the world. The
philosopher Fichte said that nature stems from a higher, unconscious
imagination. Scheliing said explicitly that the world is &lsquo;in
God.&rsquo; God is aware of some of it, he believed, but there are
other aspects of nature which represent the unknown in God. For God
also has a dark side.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The thought is fascinating and
frightening. It reminds me of Berkeley.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;The relationship between the
artist and his work was seen in exactly the same light. The fairy
tale gave the writer free rein to exploit his &lsquo;universe-creating
imagination.&rsquo; And even the creative act was not always
completely conscious. The writer could experience that his story
was being written by some innate force. He could practically be in a
hypnotic trance while he wrote.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He could?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but then he would suddenly
destroy the illusion. He would intervene in the story and address
ironic comments to the reader, so that the reader, at least
momentarily, would be reminded that it was, after all, only a
story.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;At the same time the writer
could remind his reader that it was he who was manipulating the
fictional universe. This form of disillusion is called &lsquo;romantic
irony.&rsquo; Henrik Ibsen, for example, lets one of the characters
in Peer Gynt say: &lsquo;One cannot die in the middle of Act Five.&rsquo;
&ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very funny line,
actually. What he&rsquo;s really saying is that he&rsquo;s only
a fictional character.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The statement is so paradoxical
that we can certainly emphasize it with a new section.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What did you mean by that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, nothing, Sophie. But we did
say that Novalis&rsquo;s fiancee was called Sophie, just like you,
and that she died when she was only fifteen years and four days old
...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re scaring me, don&rsquo;t
you know that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto sat staring, stony faced. Then
he said: &ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t be worriedthat you will meet
the same fate as Novalis&rsquo;s fiancee.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because there are several more
chapters.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that anyone
reading the story of Sophie and Alberto will know intuitively that
there are many pages of the story still to come. We have only gotten
as far as Romanticism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making me dizzy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really the major
trying to make Hilde dizzy. It&rsquo;s not very nice or him, is it?
New section!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>

</P>
<p>
Alberto had hardly finished speaking
when a boy came running out of the woods. He had a turban on his
head, and he was carrying an oil lamp.</P>
<p>
Sophie grabbed Alberto&rsquo;s arm.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she
asked.</P>
<p>
The boy answered for himself: &ldquo;My
name is Aladdin and I&rsquo;ve come all the way from Lebanon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto looked at him sternly:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And what do you have in your
lamp?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The boy rubbed the lamp, and out of it
rose a thick cloud which formed itself into the figure of a man. He
had a black beard like Alberto&rsquo;s and a blue beret. Floating
above the lamp, he said: &ldquo;Can you hear me, Hilde? I suppose
it&rsquo;s too late for any more birthday greetings. I just wanted to
say that Bjerkely and the south country back home seem like fairyland
to me here in Lebanon. I&rsquo;ll see you there in a few days.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
So saying, the figure became a cloud
again and was sucked back into the lamp. The boy with the turban put
the lamp under his arm, ran into the woods, and was gone.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe this,&rdquo;
said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A bagatelle, my dear.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The spirit of the lamp spoke
exactly like Hilde&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because it was
Hilde&rsquo;s father&mdash;in spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Both you and I and everything
around us are living deep in the major&rsquo;s mind. It is late at
night on Saturday, April 28, and all the UN soldiers are asleep
around the major, who, although still awake, is not far from sleep
himself. But he must finish the book he is to give Hilde as a
fifteenth birthday present. That&rsquo;s why he has to work, Sophie,
that&rsquo;s why the poor man gets hardly any rest.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I give up.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;New section!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie and Alberto sat looking across
the little lake. Alberto seemed to be in some sort of trance.
After a while Sophie ventured to nudge his shoulder.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Were you dreaming?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he was interfering
directly there. The last few paragraphs were dictated by him to
the letter. He should be ashamed of himself. But now he has given
himself away and come out into the open. Now we know that we are
living our lives in a book which Hilde&rsquo;s father will send home
to Hilde as a birthday present. You heard what I said? Well, it
wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;me&rsquo; saying it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If what you say is true, I&rsquo;m
going to run away from the book and go my own way.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I am
planning. But before that can happen, we must try and talk with
Hilde. She reads every word we say. Once we succeed in getting away
from here it will be much harder to contact her. That means we must
grasp the opportunity now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do we say?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think the major is just about
to fall asleep over his typewriter&mdash;although his fingers are
still racing feverishly over the keys ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a creepy thought.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is the moment when he may
write something he will regret later. And he has no correction fluid.
That&rsquo;s a vital part of my plan. May no one give the major a
bottle of correction fluid!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get so much as a
single coverup strip from me!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling on that poor
girl here and now to rebel against her own father. She should be
ashamed to let herself be amused by his self-indulgent playing with
shadows. If only we had him here, we&rsquo;d give him a taste of
our indignation!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He is here in spirit and soul,
but he&rsquo;s also safely tucked away in Lebanon. Everything around
us is the major&rsquo;s ego.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But he is more than what we can
see here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We are but shadows in the
major&rsquo;s soul. And it is no easy matter for a shadow to turn on
its master, Sophie. It requires both cunning and strategy. But we
have an opportunity of influencing Hilde. Only an angel can
rebel against God.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;We could ask Hilde to give him
a piece of her mind the moment he gets home. She could tell him he&rsquo;s
a rogue. She could wreck his boat&mdash;or at least, smash the
lantern.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto nodded. Then he said: &ldquo;She
could also run away from him That would be much easier for her than
it is for us. She could leave the major&rsquo;s house and never
return. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fitting for a major who plays with his
&lsquo;universe-creating imagination&rsquo; at our expense?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can picture it. The major
travels all over the world searching for Hilde. But Hilde has
vanished into thin air because she can&rsquo;t stand living with a
father who plays the fool at Alberto&rsquo;s and Sophie&rsquo;s
expense.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it! Plays the
fool! That&rsquo;s what I meant by his using us as birthday
amusement. But he&rsquo;d better watch out, Sophie. So had Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you sitting tight?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As long as there are no more
genies from a lamp.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Try to imagine that everything
that happens to us goes on in someone else&rsquo;s mind. We are that
mind. That means we have no soul, we are someone else&rsquo;s soul.
So far we are on familiar philosophical ground. Both Berkeley and
Schelling would prick up their ears.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now it is possible that this
soul is Hilde M0ller Knag&rsquo;s father. He is over there in Lebanon
writing a book on philosophy for his daughter&rsquo;s fifteenth
birthday. When Hilde wakes up on June 15, she finds the book on her
bedside table, and now she&mdash;and anyone else&mdash;can read about
us. It has long been suggested that this &lsquo;present&rsquo; could
be shared with others.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What I am saying to you now
will be read by Hilde after her father in Lebanon once imagined that
I was telling you he was in Lebanon ... imagining me telling you
that he was in Lebanon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie&rsquo;s head was swimming. She
tried to remember what she had heard about Berkeley and the
Romantics. Alberto Knox continued: &ldquo;But they shouldn&rsquo;t
feel so cocky because of that. They are the last people who should
laugh,  because laughter can  easily get stuck  in  their throat.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Who are we talking about?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde and her father. Weren&rsquo;t
we talking about them?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But why shouldn&rsquo;t they
feel so cocky?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because it is feasible that
they, too, are nothing but mind.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How could they be?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If it was possible for Berkeley
and the Romantics, it must be possible for them. Maybe the major is
also a shadow in a book about him and Hilde, which is also about us,
since we are a part of their lives.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That would be even worse. That
makes us only shadows of shadows.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it is possible that a
completely different author is somewhere writing a book about a UN
Major Albert Knag, who is writing a book for his daughter Hilde. This
book is about a certain Alberto Knox who suddenly begins to send
humble philosophical lectures to Sophie Amundsen, 3 Clover Close.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s
possible. To us, that author would be a &lsquo;hidden God.&rsquo;
Although everything we are and everything we say and do proceeds from
him, because we are him we will never be able to know anything about
him. We are in the innermost box.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto and Sophie now sat for a long
time without saying anything. It was Sophie who finally broke the
silence: &ldquo;But if there really is an author who is writing
a story about Hilde&rsquo;s father in Lebanon, just like he is
writing a story about us . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;... then it&rsquo;s possible
that author shouldn&rsquo;t be cocky either.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He is sitting somewhere, hiding
both Hilde and me deep inside his head. Isn&rsquo;t it just possible
that he, too, is part of a higher mind?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Atberto nodded.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course it is, Sophie. That&rsquo;s
also a possibility. And if that is the way it is, it means he has
permitted us to have this philosophical conversation in order to
present this possibility. He wishes to emphasize that he, too,
is a helpless shadow, and that this book, in which Hilde and Sophie
appear, is in reality a textbook on philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A textbook?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because all our conversations,
all our dialogues ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;... are in reality one long
monologue.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I get the feeling that
everything is dissolving into mind and spirit. I&rsquo;m glad there
are still a few philosophers left. The philosophy that began so
proudly with Thales, Em-pedocles, and Democritus can&rsquo;t be
stranded here, surely?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course not. I still have to
tell you about Hegel. He was the first philosopher who tried to
salvage philosophy when the Romantics had dissolved everything into
spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very curious.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So as not to be interrupted by
any further spirits or shadows, we shall go inside.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting chilly out
here anyway.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Next chapter!&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>Hegel</h3><br />
<p>
... the reasonable is that which is viable&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Hilde let the big ring binder fall to the floor with a heavy thud.
She lay on her bed staring up at the ceiling. Her thoughts were in a
turmoil.</P>
<p>
Now her father really had made her head swim. The rascal! How could
he?</P>
<p>
Sophie had tried to talk directly to her. She had asked her to rebel
against her father. And she had really managed to plant an idea
in Hilde&rsquo;s mind. A plan ...</P>
<p>
Sophie and Alberto could not so much as harm a hair on his head, but
Hilde could. And through Hilde, Sophie could reach her father.</P>
<p>
She agreed with Sophie and Alberto that he was going too far in his
game of shadows. Even if he had only made Alberto and Sophie up,
there were limits to the show of power he ought to permit himself.</P>
<p>
Poor Sophie and Alberto! They were just as defenseless against
the major&rsquo;s imagination as a movie screen is against the film
projector.</P>
<p>
Hilde would certainly teach him a lesson when he got home! She could
already see the outline of a really good plan.</P>
<p>
She got up and went to look out over the bay. It was almost two
o&rsquo;clock. She opened the window and called over toward the
boathouse.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother came out.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be down with some sandwiches in about an hour.
Okay?&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I just have to read a chapter on Hegel.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Alberto and Sophie had seated
themselves in the two chairs by the window facing the lake.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich
Hege/was a legitimate child of Romanticism,&rdquo; began Alberto.
&ldquo;One could almost say he developed with the German spirit as it
gradually evolved in Germany. He was born in Stuttgart in 1770, and
began to study theology in Tubingen at the age of eighteen. Beginning
in 1799, he worked with Schelling in Jena during the time when the
Romantic Movement was experiencing its most explosive growth. After a
period as assistant professor in Jena he became a professor in
Heidelberg, the center of German National Romanticism. In 1818
he was appointed professor in Berlin, just at the time when the city
was becoming the spiritual center of Europe. He died of cholera in
1831, but not before &lsquo;He-gelianism&rsquo; had gained an
enormous following at nearly all the universities in Germany.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he covered a lot of ground.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and so did his philosophy.
Hegel united and developed almost all the ideas that had
surfaced in the Romantic period. But he was sharply critical of
many of the Romantics, including Schelling.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What was it he criticized?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Schelling as well as other
Romantics had said that the deepest meaning of life lay in what they
called the &lsquo;world spirit.&rsquo; Hegel also uses the term
&lsquo;world spirit,&rsquo; but in a new sense. When Hegel talks of
&lsquo;world spirit&rsquo; or &lsquo;world reason,&rsquo; he
means the sum of human utterances, because only man has a &lsquo;spirit.&rsquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In this sense, he can speak of
the progress of world spirit throughout history. However, we must
never forget that he is referring to human life, human thought, and
human culture.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That makes this spirit much
less spooky. It is not lying in wait anymore like a &lsquo;slumbering
intelligence&rsquo; in rocks and trees.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Now, you remember that Kant
had talked about something he called &lsquo;das Ding an sich.&rsquo;
Although he denied that man could have any clear cognition of
the innermost secrets of nature, he admitted that there exists a
kind of unattainable &lsquo;truth.&rsquo; Hegel said that &lsquo;truth
is subjective/ thus rejecting the existence of any &lsquo;truth&rsquo;
above or beyond human reason. All knowledge is human knowledge,
he said.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He had to get the philosophers
down to earth again, right?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, perhaps you could say
that. However, Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy was so all-embracing and
diversified that for present purposes we shall content ourselves
with highlighting some of the main aspects. It is actually doubtful
whether one can say that Hegel had his own &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo;
at all. What is usually known as Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy is mainly a
method for understanding the progress of history. Hegel&rsquo;s
philosophy teaches us nothing about the inner nature of life, but it
can teach us to think productively.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not unimportant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All the philosophical systems
before Hegel had had one thing in common, namely, the attempt to set
up eternal criteria for what man can know about the world. This
was true of Descartes, Spinoza, Hume, and Kant. Each and every one
had tried to investigate the basis of human cognition. But they had
all made pronouncements on the timeless factor of human knowledge of
the world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a
philosopher&rsquo;s job?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hegel did not believe it was
possible. He believed that the basis of human cognition changed from
one generation to the next. There were therefore no &lsquo;eternal
truths/ no timeless reason. The only fixed point philosophy can hold
on to is history itself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll
have to explain that. History is in a constant state of change, so
how can it be a fixed point?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A river is also in a constant
state of change. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t talk about
it. But you cannot say at which place in the valley the river is the
&lsquo;truest&rsquo; river.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, because it&rsquo;s just as
much river all the way through.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So to Hegel, history was like a
running river. Every tiny movement in the water at a given spot in
the river is determined by the falls and eddies in the water higher
upstream. But these movements are determined, too, by the rocks and
bends in the river at the point where you are observing it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I get it... I think.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And the history of thought&mdash;or
of reason&mdash;is like this river. The thoughts that are washed
along with the current of past tradition, as well as the material
conditions prevailing at the time, help to determine how you
think. You can therefore never claim that any particular thought is
correct for ever and ever. But the thought can be correct from where
you stand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the same as
saying that everything is equally right or equally wrong, is it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Certainly not, but some things
can be right or wrong in relation to a certain historical context. If
you advocated slavery today, you would at best be thought foolish.
But you wouldn&rsquo;t have been considered foolish 2,500 years ago,
even though there were already progressive voices in favor of
slavery&rsquo;s abolition. But we can take a more local example. Not
more than 100 years ago it was not considered unreasonable to burn
off large areas of forest in order to cultivate the land. But it is
extremely unreasonable today. We have a completely different&mdash;and
better&mdash;basis for such judgments.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hegel pointed out that as
regards philosophical reflection, also, reason is dynamic; it&rsquo;s
a process, in fact. And the &lsquo;truth&rsquo; is this same process,
since there are no criteria beyond the historical process itself that
can determine what is the most true or the most reasonable.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Examples, please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You cannot single out
particular thoughts from antiquity, the Middle Ages, the
Renaissance, or the Enlightenment and say they were right or
wrong. By the same token, you cannot say that Plato was wrong and
that Aristotle was right. Neither can you say that Hume was
wrong but Kant and Schelling were right. That would be an
antihistorical way of thinking.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t sound
right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;In fact, you cannot detach any
philosopher, or any thought at all, from that philosopher&rsquo;s or
that thought&rsquo;s historical context. But&mdash;and here I come to
another point&mdash;because something new is always being added,
reason is &lsquo;progressive.&rsquo; In other words, human knowledge
is constantly expanding and progressing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does that mean that Kant&rsquo;s
philosophy is nevertheless more right than Plato&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. The world spirit has
developed&mdash;and progressed&mdash;from Plato to Kant. And
it&rsquo;s a good thing! If we return to the example of the river, we
could say that there is now more water in it. It has been running for
over a thousand years. Only Kant shouldn&rsquo;t think that his
&lsquo;truths&rsquo; will remain on the banks of the river like
immovable rocks. Kant&rsquo;s ideas get processed too, and his
&lsquo;reason&rsquo; becomes the subject of future generations&rsquo;
criticism. Which is exactly what has happened.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But the river you talked about.
. .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Where does it go?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hegel claimed that the &lsquo;world
spirit&rsquo; is developing toward an ever-expanding knowledge
of itself. It&rsquo;s the same with rivers&mdash;they become broader
and broader as they get nearer to the sea. According to Hegel,
history is the story of the &lsquo;world spirit&rsquo; gradually
coming to consciousness of itself. Although the world has always
existed, human culture and human development have made the world
spirit increasingly conscious of its intrinsic value.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How could he be so sure of
that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He claimed it as a historical
reality. It was not a prediction. Anybody who studies history
will see that humanity has advanced toward ever-increasing
&lsquo;self-knowledge&rsquo; and &lsquo;self-development.&rsquo;
According to Hegel, the study of history shows that humanity is
moving toward greater rationality and freedom. In spite of all
its capers, historical development is progressive. We say that
history is purposeful.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So it develops. That&rsquo;s
clear enough.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. History is one long chain
of reflections. Hegel also indicated certain rules that apply for
this chain of reflections. Anyone studying history in depth will
observe that a thought is usually proposed on the basis of other,
previously proposed thoughts. But as soon as one thought is proposed,
it will be contradicted by another. A tension arises between these
two opposite ways of thinking. But the tension is resolved by the
proposal of a third thought which accommodates the best of both
points of view. Hegel calls this a dialectic process.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Could you give an example?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You remember that the
pre-Socratics discussed the question of primeval substance and
change?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;More or less.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then the Eleatics claimed that
change was in fact impossible. They were therefore forced to
deny any change even though they could register the changes through
their senses. The Eleatics had put forward a claim, and Hegel called
a standpoint like that a thesis.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But whenever such an extreme
claim is proposed, a contradictory claim will arise. Hegel called
this a nega-tion. The negation of the Eleatic philosophy was
Heracli-tus, who said that everything flows. There is now a tension
between two diametrically opposed schools of thought. But this
tension was resolved when Empedocles pointed out that both claims
were partly right and partly wrong.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it all comes back to me
now . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Eleatics were right in that
nothing actually changes, but they were not right in holding that we
cannot rely on our senses. Heraclitus had been right in that we can
rely on our senses, but not right in holding that everything
flows.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because there was more than one
substance. It was the combination that flowed, not the substance
itself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Right! Empedocles&rsquo;
standpoint&mdash;which provided the compromise between the two
schools of thought&mdash;was what Hegel called the negation of the
negation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a terrible term!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He also called these three
stages of knowledge thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. You could, for
example, say that Descartes&rsquo;s rationalism was a thesis&mdash;which
was contradicted by Hume&rsquo;s empirical antithesis. But the
contradiction, or the tension between two modes of thought, was
resolved in Kant&rsquo;s synthesis. Kant agreed with the
rationalists in some things and with the empiricists in others.
But the story doesn&rsquo;t end with Kant. Kant&rsquo;s synthesis now
becomes the point of departure for another chain of
reflections, or &lsquo;triad.&rsquo; Because a synthesis will
also be contradicted by a new antithesis.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very
theoretical!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it certainly is
theoretical. But Hegel didn&rsquo;t see it as pressing history into
any kind of framework. He believed that history itself revealed
this dialectical pattern. He thus claimed he had uncovered certain
laws for the development of reason&mdash;or for the progress of the
&lsquo;world spirit&rsquo; through history.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But Hegel&rsquo;s dialectic is
not only applicable to history. When we discuss something, we think
dialectically. We try to find flaws in the argument. Hegel called
that &lsquo;negative thinking.&rsquo; But when we find flaws in
an argument, we preserve the best of it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Give me an example.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, when a socialist and a
conservative sit down together to resolve a social problem, a tension
will quickly be revealed between their conflicting modes of thought.
But this does not mean that one is absolutely right and the other
totally wrong. It is possible that they are both partly right and
partly wrong. And as the argument evolves, the best of both arguments
will often crystallize.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But while we are in the throes
of a discussion like that, it is not easy to decide which position is
more rational. In a way, it&rsquo;s up to history to decide what&rsquo;s
right and what&rsquo;s wrong. The reasonable is that which is
viable.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Whatever survives is right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Or vice versa: that which is
right survives.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a tiny
example for me?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;One hundred and fifty years ago
there were a lot of people fighting for women&rsquo;s rights. Many
people also bitterly opposed giving women equal rights. When we
read the arguments of both sides today, it is not difficult to see
which side had the more &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; opinions. But we
must not forget that we have the knowledge of hindsight.</P>
<p>
If &lsquo;proved to be the case&rsquo;
that those who fought for equality were right. A lot of people
would no doubt cringe if they saw in print what their grandfathers
had said on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they would. What
was Hegel&rsquo;s view?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;About equality of the sexes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what we are
talking about?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you like to hear a
quote?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Very much.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo; The difference between man and
woman is like that between animals and plants,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Men
correspond to animals, while women correspond to plants because their
development is more placid and the principle that underlies it is the
rather vague unity of feeling. When women hold the helm of
government, the state is at once in jeopardy, because women regulate
their actions not by the demands of universality but by arbitrary
inclinations and opinions. Women are educated&mdash;who knows how?&mdash;as
it were by breathing in ideas, by living rather than by acquiring
knowledge. The status of manhood, on the other hand, is attained only
by the stress of thought and much technical exertion.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, that will be quite
enough. I&rsquo;d rather not hear any more statements like that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it is a striking example of
how people&rsquo;s views of what is rational change all the time. It
shows that Hegel was also a child of his time. And so are we. Our
&lsquo;obvious&rsquo; views will not stand the test of time either.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What views, for example?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no such examples.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because I would be exemplifying
things that are already undergoing a change. For instance, I
could say it&rsquo;s stupid to drive a car because cars pollute the
environment. Lots of people think this already. But history will
prove that much of what we think is obvious will not hold up in the
light of history.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We can also observe something
else: The many men in Hegel&rsquo;s time who could reel off gross
broadsides like that one on the inferiority of women hastened the
development of feminism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They proposed a thesis. Why?
Because women had already begun to rebel. There&rsquo;s no need to
have an opinion on something everyone agrees on. And the more
grossly they expressed themselves about women&rsquo;s inferiority,
the stronger became the negation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You might say that the very
best that can happen is to have energetic opponents. The more extreme
they become, the more powerful the reaction they will have to
face. There&rsquo;s a saying about &lsquo;more grist to the mill.&rsquo;
&ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;My mill began to grind more
energetically a minute ago!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;From the point of view of pure
logic or philosophy, there will often be a dialectical tension
between two concepts.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For example?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If I reflect on the concept of
&lsquo;being,&rsquo; I will be obliged to introduce the opposite
concept, that of &lsquo;nothing.&rsquo; You can&rsquo;t reflect on
your existence without immediately realizing that you won&rsquo;t
always exist. The tension between &lsquo;being&rsquo; and &lsquo;nothing&rsquo;
becomes resolved in the concept of &lsquo;becoming.&rsquo; Because if
something is in the process of becoming, it both is and is not.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hegel&rsquo;s &lsquo;reason&rsquo;
is thus dynamic logic. Since reality is characterized by opposites, a
description of reality must therefore also be full of opposites. Here
is another example for you: the Danish nuclear physicist Niels
Bohr is said to have told a story about Newton&rsquo;s having a
horseshoe over his front door.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for luck.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it is only a superstition,
and Newton was anything but superstitious. When someone asked him if
he really believed in that kind of thing, he said, &lsquo;No, I
don&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m told it works anyway.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But his answer was quite
dialectical, a contradiction in terms, almost. Niels Bohr, who, like
our own Norwegian poet Vinje, was known for his ambivalence, once
said: There are two kinds of truths. There are the superficial
truths, the opposite of which are obviously wrong. But there are also
the profound truths, whose op-posites are equally right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What kind of truths can they
be?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If I say life is short, for
example . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I would agree.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But on another occasion I could
throw open my arms and say life is long.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. That&rsquo;s
also true, in a sense.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Finally I&rsquo;ll give you an
example of how a dialectic tension can result in a spontaneous act
which leads to a sudden change.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, do.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Imagine a young girl who always
answers her mother with Yes, Mom ... Okay, Mom ... As you wish, Mom
... At once, Mom.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Gives me the shudders!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Finally the girl&rsquo;s mother
gets absolutely maddened by her daughter&rsquo;s overobedience, and
shouts: Stop being such a goody-goody! And the girl answers: Okay,
Mom.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I would have slapped her.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps. But what would you
have done if the girl had answered instead: But I wonf to be a
goody-goody?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That would have been an odd
answer. Maybe I would have slapped her anyway.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In other words, the situation
was deadlocked. The dialectic tension had come to a point where
something had to happen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like a slap in the face?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A final aspect of Hegel&rsquo;s
philosophy needs to be mentioned here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you remember how we said
that the Romantics were individualists?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The path of mystery leads
inwards ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This individualism also met its
negation, or opposite, in Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy. Hegel emphasized
what he called the &lsquo;objective&rsquo; powers. Among such powers,
Hegel emphasized the importance of the family, civil society,
and the state. You might say that Hegel was somewhat skeptical
of the individual. He believed that the individual was an organic
part of the community. Reason, or &lsquo;world spirit/ came to light
first and foremost in the interplay of people.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Explain that more clearly,
please!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Reason manifests itself above
all in language. And a language is something we are born into. The
Norwegian language manages quite well without Mr. Hansen, but Mr.
Hansen cannot manage without Norwegian. It is thus not the individual
who forms the language, it is the language which forms the
individual.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I guess you could say so.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In the same way that a baby is
born into a language, it is also born into its historical background.
And nobody has a &lsquo;free&rsquo; relationship to that kind of
background. He who does not find his place within the state is
therefore an unhistorical person. This idea, you may recall, was also
central for the great Athenian philosophers. Just as the state is
unthinkable without citizens, citizens are unthinkable without
the state.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Obviously.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;According to Hegel, the state
is &lsquo;more&rsquo; than the individual citizen. It is
moreover more than the sum of its citizens. So Hegel says one
cannot &lsquo;resign from society.&rsquo; Anyone who simply shrugs
their shoulders at the society they live in and wants to &lsquo;find
their soul/ will therefore be ridiculed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I
wholly agree, but okay.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;According to Hegel, it is not
the individual that finds itself, it is the world spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The world spirit finds itself?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hegel said that the world
spirit returns to itself in three stages. By that he means that it
becomes conscious of itself in three stages.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Which are?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The world spirit first becomes
conscious of itself in the individual. Hegel calls this subjective
spirit. It reaches a higher consciousness in the family, civil
society, and the state. Hegel calls this objective spirit because it
appears in interaction between people. But there is a third stage
...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that is ... ?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The world spirit reaches the
highest form of self-realization in absolute spirit. And this
absolute spirit is art, religion, and philosophy. And of these,
philosophy is the highest form of knowledge because in philosophy,
the world spirit reflects on its own impact on history. So the world
spirit first meets itself in philosophy. You could say, perhaps, that
philosophy is the mirror of the world spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is so mysterious that I
need to have time to think it over. But I liked the last bit you
said.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What, that philosophy is the
mirror of the world spirit?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that was beautiful. Do you
think it has anything to do with the brass mirror?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Since you ask, yes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I assume the brass mirror has
some special significance since it is constantly cropping up.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You must have an idea what that
significance is?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t. I merely said
that it wouldn&rsquo;t keep coming up unless it had a special
significance for Hilde and her father. What that significance is only
Hilde knows.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was that romantic irony?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A hopeless question, Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s not us
working with these things. We are only hapless victims of that irony.
If an overgrown child draws something on a piece of paper, you can&rsquo;t
ask the paper what the drawing is supposed to represent.&rdquo;</P>

<p>
Hilde looked at her watch. It was already past four o&rsquo;clock.
She laid the ring binder on her desk and ran downstairs to the
kitchen. She had to get down to the boathouse before her mother got
tired of waiting for her. She glanced at the brass mirror as she
passed.</P>
<p>
She quickly put the kettle on for tea and fixed some sandwiches.</P>
<p>
She had made up her mind to play a few tricks on her father. Hilde
was beginning to feel more and more allied with Sophie and Alberto.
Her plan would start when he got to Copenhagen.</P>
<p>
She went down to the boathouse with a large tray.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our brunch,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
Her mother was holding a block wrapped in sandpaper. She pushed
a stray lock of hair back from her forehead. There was sand in
her hair too.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drop dinner, then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They sat down outside on the dock and began to eat.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When&rsquo;s Dad arriving?&rdquo; asked Hilde after a while.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;On Saturday. I thought you knew that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But what time? Didn&rsquo;t you say he was changing planes in
Copenhagen?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.</P>
<p>
Her mother took a bite of her sandwich.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He gets to Copenhagen at about five. The plane to Kristiansand
leaves at a quarter to eight. He&rsquo;ll probably land at Kjevik at
half-past nine.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So he has a few hours at Kastrup ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing. I was just wondering.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
When Hilde thought a suitable interval had elapsed, she said
casually, &ldquo;Have you heard from Anne and Ole lately?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They call from time to time. They are coming home on vacation
sometime in July.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not before?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So they&rsquo;ll be in Copenhagen this week... ?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why all these questions, Hilde?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No reason. Just small talk.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You mentioned Copenhagen twice.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I did?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We talked about Dad touching down in ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably why I thought of Anne and Ole.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
As soon as they finished eating, Hilde collected the mugs and plates
on the tray.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have to get on with my reading, Mom.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I guess you must.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Was there a touch of reproach in her voice? They had talked about
fixing up the boat together before Dad came home.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Dad almost made me promise to finish the book before he
got home.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little crazy. When he&rsquo;s away, he doesn&rsquo;t
have to order us around back home.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you only knew how much he orders people around,&rdquo; said
Hilde enigmatically, &ldquo;and you can&rsquo;t imagine how much he
enjoys it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She returned to her room and went on reading.</P>
<p>
Suddenly Sophie heard a knock on the
door. Alberto looked at her severely.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t wish to be
disturbed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The knocking became louder.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am going to tell you about a
Danish philosopher who was infuriated by Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy,&rdquo;
said Alberto.</P>
<p>
The knocking on the door grew so
violent that the whole door shook.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the major, of
course, sending some phantasm to see whether we swallow the bait,&rdquo;
said Alberto. &ldquo;It costs him no effort at all.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But if we don&rsquo;t open the
door and see who it is, it won&rsquo;t cost him any effort to tear
the whole place down either.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You might have a point there.
We&rsquo;d better open the door then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They went to the door. Since the
knocking had been so forceful, Sophie expected to see a very large
person. But standing on the front step was a little girl with long
fair hair, wearing a blue dress. She had a small bottle in each hand.
One bottle was red, the other blue.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; said Sophie. &ldquo;Who
are you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;My name is Alice,&rdquo; said
the girl, curtseying shyly.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said
Alberto, nodding. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Alice in Wonderland.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How did she find her way to
us?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alice explained: &ldquo;Wonderland is
a completely borderless country. That means that Wonderland is
everywhere&mdash;rather like the UN. It should be an honorary
member of the UN. We should have representatives on all committees,
because the UN also arose out of people&rsquo;s wonder.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hm ... that major!&rdquo;
muttered Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And what brings you here?&rdquo;
asked Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am to give Sophie these
little philosophy bottles.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She handed the bottles to Sophie.
There was red liquid in one and blue in the other. The label on the
red bottle read DRINK ME, and on the blue one the label read DRINK ME
too.</P>
<p>
The next second a white rabbit came
hurrying past the cabin. It walked upright on two legs and was
dressed in a waistcoat and jacket. Just in front of the cabin it took
a pocket watch out of its waistcoat pocket and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be
too late!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Then it ran on. Alice began to run
after it. Just before she ran into the woods, she curtsied and said,
&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s starting again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Say hello to Dinah and the
Queen,&rdquo; Sophie called after her.</P>
<p>
Alberto and Sophie remained standing
on the front step, examining the bottles.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;DRINK ME and DRINK ME too,&rdquo;
read Sophie. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I dare. They might be
poisonous.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto merely shrugged his shoulders.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They come from the major, and
everything that comes from the major is purely in the mind. So it&rsquo;s
only pretend-juice.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie took the cap off the red bottle
and put it cautiously to her lips. The juice had a strangely
sweet taste, but that wasn&rsquo;t all. As she drank, something
started to happen to her surroundings.</P>
<p>
It felt as if the lake and the woods
and the cabin all merged into one. Soon it seemed that everything she
saw was one person, and that person was Sophie herself. She glanced
up at Alberto, but he too seemed to be part of Sophie&rsquo;s soul.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Curiouser and curiouser,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Everything looks like it did before, but now it&rsquo;s
all one thing. I feel as if everything is one thought.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto nodded&mdash;but it seemed to
Sophie that it was she nodding to herself.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is Pantheism or Idealism,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It is the Romantics&rsquo; world spirit. They
experienced everything as one big &lsquo;ego.&rsquo; It is also
Hegel&mdash;who was critical of the individual, and who saw
everything as the expression of the one and only world reason.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Should I drink from the other
bottle too?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It says so on the label.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie took the cap off the blue
bottle and took a large gulp. This juice tasted fresher and sharper
than the other. Again everything around her changed suddenly.</P>
<p>
Instantly the effects of the red
bottle disappeared and everything slid back to its normal place.
Alberto was Alberto, the trees were back in the woods and the
water looked like a lake again.</P>
<p>
But it only lasted for a second,
because things went on sliding away from each other. The woods were
no longer woods and every little tree now seemed like a world in
itself. The tiniest twig was like a fairy-tale world about which a
thousand stories could be told.</P>
<p>
The little lake suddenly became a
boundless ocean&mdash; not in depth or breadth, but in its glittering
detail and the intricate patterns of its waves. Sophie felt she might
spend a lifetime staring at this water and to her dying day it would
still remain an unfathomable mystery.</P>
<p>
She looked up at the crown of a tree.
Three little sparrows were engrossed in a curious game. Was it
hide-and-seek? Sophie had known in a way that there were birds in
this tree, even after she had drunk from the red bottle, but she had
not really seen them properly. The red juice had erased all contrasts
and all individual differences.</P>
<p>
Sophie jumped down from the large flat
stone step they were standing on and bent over to look at the grass.
There she discovered another new world&mdash;like a deep-sea diver
opening his eyes under water for the first time. In amongst the twigs
and straws of grass, the moss was teeming with tiny details. Sophie
watched a spider make its way over the moss, surefooted and
purposeful, a red plant louse running up and down a blade of grass,
and a whole army of ants laboring in a united effort in the grass.
But each tiny ant moved its legs in its own particular manner.</P>
<p>
The most curious of all was the sight
that met her eyes when she stood up again and looked at Alberto,
still standing on the front step of the cabin. In Alberto she now saw
a wondrous person&mdash;he was like a being from another planet,
or an enchanted figure out of a fairy tale. At the same time she
experienced herself in a completely new way as a unique individual.
She was more than just a human being, a fifteen-year-old girl. She
was Sophie Amundsen, and only she was that.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; asked
Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see that you&rsquo;re a
strange bird.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll
ever get to understand what it&rsquo;s like being another person. No
two people in the whole world are alike.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And the woods?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem the same
any more. They&rsquo;re like a whole universe of wondrous tales.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;It is as I suspected. The blue
bottle is individualism. It is, for example, S0ren Kierkegaard&rsquo;s
reaction to the idealism of the Romantics. But it also
encompasses another Dane who lived at the same time as Kierkegaard,
the famous fairy-tale writer Hans Christian Andersen. He had the
same sharp eye for nature&rsquo;s incredible richness of detail.
A philosopher who saw the same thing more than a century earlier was
the German Leibniz. He reacted against the idealistic philosophy of
Spinoza just as Kierkegaard reacted against Hegel.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I hear you, but you sound so
funny that I feel like laughing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s understandable,
just take another sip from the red bottle. Come on, let&rsquo;s sit
here on the step. We&rsquo;ll talk a bit about Kierkegaard before we
stop for today.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie sat on the step beside Alberto.
She drank a little from the red bottle and things began to merge
together again. They actually merged rather too much; once more she
got the feeling that no differences mattered at all. But she only had
to touch the blue bottle to her lips again, and the world about her
looked more or less as it did when Alice arrived with the two
bottles.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But which is true?&rdquo; she
now asked. &ldquo;Is it the red or the blue bottle that gives the
true picture?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Both the red and the blue,
Sophie. We cannot say the Romantics were wrong in holding that there
is only one reality. But maybe they were a little bit narrow in their
outlook.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What about the blue bottle?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think Kierkegaard must have
taken a few hefty swigs from that one. He certainly had a sharp eye
for the significance of the individual. We are more than
&lsquo;children of our time.&rsquo; And moreover, every single one of
us is a unique individual who only lives once.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And Hegel had not made much of
that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, he was more interested in
the broad scope of history. This was just what made Kierkegaard so
indignant. He thought that both the idealism of the Romantics
and Hegel&rsquo;s &lsquo;historicism&rsquo; had obscured the
individual&rsquo;s responsibility for his own life. Therefore to
Kierkegaard, Hegel and the Romantics were tarred with the same
brush.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;I can see why he was so mad.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;S0ren Kierkegaard was born in
1813 and was subjected to a very severe upbringing by his
father. His religious melancholia was a legacy from this
father.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That sounds ominous.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was because of this
melancholia that he felt obliged to break off his engagement,
something the Copenhagen bourgeoisie did not look kindly on. So from
early on he became an outcast and an object of scorn. However, he
gradually learned to give as good as he got, and he became
increasingly what Ibsen later on described as &lsquo;an enemy of the
people.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All because of a broken
engagement?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not only because of that.
Toward the end of his life, especially, he became aggressively
critical of society. &lsquo;The whole of Europe is on the road to
bankruptcy,&rsquo; he said. He believed he was living in an age
utterly devoid of passion and commitment. He was particularly
incensed by the vapidness of the established Danish Lutheran Church.
He was merciless in his criticism of what you might call &lsquo;Sunday
Christianity.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nowadays we talk of
&lsquo;confirmation Christianity.&rsquo; Most kids only get confirmed
because of all the presents they get.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve got the
point. To Kierkegaard, Christianity was both so overwhelming and so
irrational that it had to be an either/or. It was not good being
&lsquo;rather&rsquo; or &lsquo;to some extent&rsquo; religious.
Because either Jesus rose on Easter Day&mdash;or he did not. And if
he really did rise from the dead, if he really died for our sake&mdash;then
this is so overwhelming that it must permeate our entire life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I think I understand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But Kierkegaard saw how both
the church and people in general had a noncommittal approach to
religious questions. To Kierkegaard, religion and knowledge were like
fire and water. It was not enough to believe that Christianity
is &lsquo;true.&rsquo; Having a Christian faith meant following a
Christian way of life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What did that have to do with
Hegel?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Maybe we
started at the wrong end.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So I suggest you go into
reverse and start again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Kierkegaard began his study of
theology when he was seventeen, but he became increasingly absorbed
in philosophical questions. When he was twenty-seven he took his
master&rsquo;s degree with the dissertation &lsquo;On the Concept of
Irony.&rsquo; In this work he did battle with Romantic irony and the
Romantics&rsquo; uncommitted play with illusion. He posited &lsquo;Socratic
irony&rsquo; in contrast. Even though Socrates had made use of irony
to great effect, it had the purpose of eliciting the fundamental
truths about life. Unlike the Romantics, Socrates was what
Kierkegaard called an &lsquo;existential&rsquo; thinker. That is
to say, a thinker who draws his entire existence into his
philosophical reflection.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;After breaking off his
engagement in 1841, Kierkegaard went to Berlin where he attended
Schelling&rsquo;s lectures.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did he meet Hegel?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, Hegel had died ten years
earlier, but his ideas were predominant in Berlin and in many parts
of Europe. His &lsquo;system&rsquo; was being used as a kind of
all-purpose explanation for every type of question. Kierkegaard
indicated that the sort of &lsquo;objective truths&rsquo; that
Hegelianism was concerned with were totally irrelevant to the
personal life of the individual.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What kind of truths are
relevant, then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;According to Kierkegaard,
rather than searching for the Truth with a capital T, it is more
important to find the kind of truths that are meaningful to the
individual&rsquo;s life. It is important to find &lsquo;the truth for
me.&rsquo; He thus sets the individual, or each and every man, up
against the &lsquo;system.&rsquo; Kierkegaard thought Hegel had
forgotten that he was a man. This is what he wrote about the Hegelian
professor: &ldquo;While the ponderous Sir Professor explains the
entire mystery of life, he has in distraction forgotten his own name;
that he is a man, neither more nor less, not a fantastic
three-eighths of a paragraph.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And what, according to
Kierkegaard, is a man?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible to say
in general terms. A broad description of human nature or human
beings was totally without interest to Kierkegaard. The only
important thing was each man&rsquo;s &lsquo;own existence.&rsquo; And
you don&rsquo;t experience your own existence behind a desk. It&rsquo;s
only when we act&mdash;and especially when we make significant
choices&mdash;that we relate to our own existence. There is a story
about Buddha that illustrates what Kierkegaard meant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;About Buddha?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, since Buddha&rsquo;s
philosophy also took man&rsquo;s existence as its starting
point. There was once a monk who asked Buddha if he could give
clearer answers to fundamental questions on what the world is
and what a man is. Buddha answered by likening the monk to a man who
gets pierced by a poisoned arrow. The wounded man would have no
theoretical interest in what the arrow was made of, what kind of
poison it was dipped in, or which direction it came from.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He would most likely want
somebody to pull it out and treat the wound.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he would. That would be
existentially important to him. Both Buddha and Kierkegaard had a
strong sense of only existing for a brief moment. And as I said, then
you don&rsquo;t sit down behind a desk and philosophize about the
nature of the world spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kierkegaard also said that
truth is &lsquo;subjective.&rsquo; By this he did not mean that it
doesn&rsquo;t matter what we think or believe. He meant that the
really important truths are personal. Only these truths are
&lsquo;true for me.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Could you give an example of a
subjective truth?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;An important question is, for
example, whether Christianity is true. This is not a question
one can relate to theoretically or academically. For a person who
&lsquo;understands himself in life,&rsquo; it is a question of
life and death. It is not something you sit and discuss for
discussion&rsquo;s sake. It is something to be approached with the
greatest passion and sincerity.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Understandable.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you fall into the water, you
have no theoretical interest in whether or not you will drown.
It is neither &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; nor &lsquo;uninteresting&rsquo;
whether there are alligators in the water. It is a question of life
or death.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I get it, thank you very much.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;So we must therefore
distinguish between the philosophical question of whether God
exists and the individual&rsquo;s relationship to the same
question, a situation in which each and every man is utterly alone.
Fundamental questions such as these can only be approached through
faith. Things we can know through reason, or knowledge, are according
to Kierkegaard totally unimportant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better
explain that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Eight plus four is twelve. We
can be absolutely certain of this. That&rsquo;s an example of the
sort of &lsquo;reasoned truth&rsquo; that every philosopher since
Descartes had talked about. But do we include it in our daily
prayers? Is it something we will lie pondering over when we are
dying? Not at all. Truths like those can be both &lsquo;objective&rsquo;
and &lsquo;general,&rsquo; but they are nevertheless totally
immaterial to each man&rsquo;s existence.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What about faith?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You can never know whether a
person forgives you when you wrong them. Therefore it is
existentially important to you. It is a question you are
intensely concerned with. Neither can you know whether a person loves
you. It&rsquo;s something you just have to believe or hope. But these
things are more important to you than the fact that the sum of the
angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. You don&rsquo;t think about the
law of cause and effect or about modes of perception when you
are in the middle of your first kiss.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be very odd if you
did.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith is the most important
factor in religious questions. Kierkegaard wrote: &lsquo;If I am
capable of grasping God objectively, I do not believe, but precisely
because I cannot do this I must believe. If I wish to preserve myself
in faith I must constantly be intent upon holding fast the objective
uncertainty, so as to remain out upon the deep, over seventy thousand
fathoms of water, still preserving my faith.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s heavy stuff.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Many had previously tried to
prove the existence of God&mdash;or at any rate to bring him within
the bounds of rationality. But if you content yourself with some such
proof or logical argument, you suffer a loss of faith, and with it, a
loss of religious passion. Because what matters is not whether
Christianity is true, but whether it is true for you. The same
thought was expressed in the Middle Ages in the maxim: credo quid
absurdum.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It means I believe because it
is irrational. If Christianity had appealed to our reason, and not to
other sides of us, it would not be a question of faith.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I understand that now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So we have looked at what
Kierkegaard meant by &lsquo;existential,&rsquo; what he meant by
&lsquo;subjective truth,&rsquo; and what his concept of &lsquo;faith&rsquo;
was. These three concepts were formulated as a criticism of
philosophical tradition in general, and of Hegel in particular.
But they also embodied a trenchant &lsquo;social criticism.&rsquo;
The individual in modern urban society had become &lsquo;the
public,&rsquo; he said, and the predominant characteristic of the
crowd, or the masses, was all their noncommittal &lsquo;talk.&rsquo;
Today we would probably use the word &lsquo;conformity&rsquo;;
that is when everybody &lsquo;thinks&rsquo; and &lsquo;believes in&rsquo;
the same things without having any deeper feeling about it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I wonder what Kierkegaard would
have said to Joanna&rsquo;s parents.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He was not always kind in his
judgments. He had a sharp pen and a bitter sense of irony. For
example, he could say things like &lsquo;the crowd is the untruth,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;the truth is always in the minority/ and that most people
had a superficial approach to life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing to collect
Barbie dolls. But it&rsquo;s worse to be one.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That brings us to Kierkegaard&rsquo;s
theory of what he called the three stages on life&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon me?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Kierkegaard believed that there
were three different forms of life. He himself used the term stages.
He calls them the aesthetic stage, the ethical stage, and the
religious stage. He used the term &lsquo;stage&rsquo; to
emphasize that one can live at one of the two lower stages and then
suddenly leap to a higher stage. Many people live at the same stage
all their life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I bet there&rsquo;s an
explanation on the way. I&rsquo;m anxious to know which stage I&rsquo;m
at.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;He who lives at the aesthetic
stage lives for the moment and grasps every opportunity of
enjoyment. Good is whatever is beautiful, satisfying, or pleasant.
This person lives wholly in the world of the senses, and is a
slave to his own desires and moods. Everything that is boring is
bad.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes thanks, I think I know that
attitude.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The typical Romantic is thus
also the typical aesthete, since there is more to it than pure
sensory enjoyment. A person who has a reflective approach to
reality&mdash;or for that matter to his art or the philosophy he or
she is engaged in&mdash;is living at the aesthetic stage. It is
even possible to have an aesthetic, or &lsquo;reflective,&rsquo;
attitude to sorrow and suffering. In which case vanity has taken
over. Ibsen&rsquo;s Peer Gynt is the portrait of a typical aesthete.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I see what you mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you know anyone like that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not completely. But I think
maybe it sounds a little like the major.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe so, maybe so, Sophie ...
Although that was another example of his rather sickly Romantic
irony. You should wash your mouth out.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All right, it wasn&rsquo;t your
fault.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Keep going, then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A person who lives at the
aesthetic stage can easily experience angst, or a sense of dread, and
a feeling of emptiness. If this happens, there is also hope.
According to Kierkegaard, angst is almost positive. It is an
expression of the fact that the individual is in an &lsquo;existential
situation,&rsquo; and can now elect to make the great leap to a
higher stage. But it either happens or it doesn&rsquo;t. It doesn&rsquo;t
help to be on the verge of making the leap if you don&rsquo;t do it
completely. It is a matter of &lsquo;either/or.&rsquo; But nobody can
do it for you. It is your own choice.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little like
deciding to quit drinking or doing drugs.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it could be like that.
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s description of this &lsquo;category of decision&rsquo;
can be somewhat reminiscent of Socrates&rsquo; view that all true
insight comes from within. The choice that leads a person to leap
from an aesthetic approach to an ethical or religious approach must
come from within. Ibsen depicts this in Peer Gynt. Another masterly
description of how existential choice springs from inner need
and despair can be found in Dosfoevsfcy&rsquo;s great novel Crime and
Punishment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The best you can do is choose a
different form of life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And so perhaps you will begin
to live at the ethical stage. This is characterized by seriousness
and consistency of moral choices. This approach is not unlike
Kant&rsquo;s ethics of duty. You try to live by the law of morals.
Kierkegaard, like Kant, drew attention first and foremost to
human temperament. The important thing is not what you may think is
precisely right or wrong. What matters is that you choose to have an
opinion at all on what is right or wrong. The aesthete&rsquo;s only
concern is whether something is fun or boring.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a risk of
becoming too serious, living like that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Decidedly! Kierkegaard never
claimed that the ethical stage was satisfactory. Even a dutiful
person will eventually get tired of always being dedicated and
meticulous. Lots of people experience that sort of fatigue reaction
late in life. Some relapse into the reflective life of their
aesthetic stage.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But others make a new leap to
the religious stage. They take the &lsquo;jump into the abyss&rsquo;
of Faith&rsquo;s &lsquo;seventy thousand fathoms.&rsquo; They
choose faith in preference to aesthetic pleasure and reason&rsquo;s
call of duty. And although it can be &lsquo;terrible to jump into the
open arms of the living God,&rsquo; as Kierkegaard put it, it is the
only path to redemption.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Christianity, you mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, because to Kierkegaard,
the religious stage was Christianity. But he also became significant
to non-Christian thinkers. Existentialism, inspired by the Danish
philosopher, flourished widely in the twentieth century.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie glanced at her watch.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly seven. I have
to run. Mom will be frantic.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She waved to the philosopher and ran
down to the boat.</P>
<br /><h3>Marx</h3><br />

</P>
<p>
Hilde got off her bed and went to the window facing the bay. When she
had started to read this Saturday, it was still Sophie&rsquo;s
fifteenth birthday. The day before had been Hilde&rsquo;s own
birthday.</P>
<p>
If her father had imagined that she would get as far as Sophie&rsquo;s
birthday yesterday, he had certainly not been realistic. She had done
nothing but read all day long. But he was right that there would only
be one more birthday greeting. It was when Alberto and Sophie had
sung Happy Birthday to her. Very embarrassing, Hilde thought.</P>
<p>
And now Sophie had invited people to a philosophical garden party on
the very day her father was due back from Lebanon. Hilde was
convinced something would happen that day which neither she nor her
father were quite sure of.</P>
<p>
But one thing was certain: before her father got home to Bjerkely he
would get a scare. That was the least she could do for Sophie and
Alberto, especially after they had appealed for help ...</P>
<p>
Her mother was still down in the boathouse. Hilde ran downstairs to
the telephone. She found Anne and Ole&rsquo;s number in Copenhagen
and called them.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Anne Kvamsdal.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hi, this is Hilde.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, how are you? How are things in Lillesand?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Fine, with vacation and everything. And Dad gets back from
Lebanon in a week.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that be great, Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. That&rsquo;s actually
why I&rsquo;m calling...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s landing at Kastrup around 5 p.m. on
Saturday the 23rd. Will you be in Copenhagen then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I was wondering if you could do something for me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, of course.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of a special favor. I&rsquo;m not even sure if
it&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re making me curious ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde began to describe her plan. She told Anne about the ring
binder, about Sophie and Alberto and all the rest. She had to
backtrack several times because either she or Anne were laughing too
hard. But when Hilde hung up, her plan was in operation.</P>
<p>
She would now have to begin some preparations of her own. But there
was still plenty of time.</P>
<p>
Hilde spent the remainder of the afternoon and the evening with her
mother. They ended up driving to Kris-tiansand and going to the
movies. They felt they had some catching up to do since they had not
done anything special the day before. As they drove past the exit to
Kjevik airport, a few more pieces of the big jigsaw puzzle Hilde
was constructing fell into place.</P>
<p>
It was late before she went to bed that night, but she took the ring
binder and read on.</P>
<p>
When Sophie slipped out of the den
through the hedge it was almost eight o&rsquo;clock. Her mother was
weeding the flowerbeds by the front door when Sophie appeared.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Where did you spring from?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I came through the hedge.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Through the hedge?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know there was
a path on the other side?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But where have you been,
Sophie? This is the second time you&rsquo;ve just disappeared without
leaving any message.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mom. It was
such a lovely day, I went for a long walk.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother rose from the pile of weeds
and gave her a severe look.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been with
that philosopher again?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I have. I
told you he likes going for long walks.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But he is coming to the garden
party, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, he&rsquo;s looking
forward to it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Me too. I&rsquo;m counting the
days.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Was there a touch of sharpness in her
voice? To be on the safe side, Sophie said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I invited
Joanna&rsquo;s parents too. Otherwise it might be a bit
embarrassing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know ... but
whatever happens, I am going to have a talk with this Alberto as one
adult to another.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You can borrow my room if you
like. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll like him.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And another thing. There&rsquo;s
a letter for you.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There is?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stamped UN
Battalion.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It must be from Alberto&rsquo;s
brother.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to stop,
Sophie!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie&rsquo;s brain worked overtime.
But in a flash she hit on a plausible answer It was as though she was
getting inspiration from some guiding spirit.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I told Alberto I collect rare
postmarks. And brothers also have their uses.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Her mother seemed to be reassured.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s in the fridge,&rdquo;
she said in a slightly more amicable tone.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the letter?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;On top of the fridge.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie rushed inside. The envelope was
stamped June 15, 1990. She opened it and took out a little note:</P>
<p>
What matters our creative endless
toil, 
</P>
<p>
When at a snatch, oblivion ends the
coil?</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Indeed, Sophie had no answer to that
question. Before she ate, she put the note in the closet together
with all the other stuff she had collected in the past weeks. She
would learn soon enough why the question had been asked.</P>
<p>
The following morning Joanna came by.
After a game of badminton, they got down to planning the
philosophical garden party. They needed to have some surprises on
hand in case the party flopped at any point.</P>
<p>
When Sophie&rsquo;s mother got home
from work they were still talking about it. Her mother kept saying:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about what it costs.&rdquo; And she was not
being sarcastic!</P>
<p>
Perhaps she was thinking that a
&ldquo;philosophical garden party&rdquo; was just what was needed to
bring Sophie down to earth again after her many weeks of intensive
philosophical studies.</P>
<p>
Before the evening was over they had
agreed on everything, from paper lanterns to a philosophical
quiz with a prize. The prize should preferably be a book about
philosophy for young people. If there was such a thing! Sophie
was not at all sure.</P>
<p>
Two days before Midsummer Eve, on
Thursday, June 21, Alberto called Sophie again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And Alberto.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, hi! How are you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well indeed, thank you. I
think I have found an excellent way out.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Way out of what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You know what. A way out of the
mental captivity we have lived in for much too long.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I cannot say a word about
the plan before it is set in motion.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be too late
then? I need to know what I am involved in.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re being na&rsquo;i&rsquo;ve.
All our conversations are being overheard. The most sensible thing
would be to say nothing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as bad as that,
huh?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Naturally, my child. The most
important things must happen when we are not talking.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We are living our lives in a
fictional reality behind the words in a long story. Each single
letter is being written on an old portable typewriter by the major.
Nothing that is in print can therefore escape his attention.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I realize that. But how are
we going to hide from him?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something going
on between the lines as well. That&rsquo;s just where I&rsquo;m
trying to be tricky, with every crafty ruse I know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I get it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But we must make the most of
the time both today and tomorrow. On Saturday the balloon goes up.
Can you come over right now?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie fed the birds and the fish and
found a large lettuce leaf for Govinda. She opened a can of cat food
for Sher-ekan and put it out in a bowl on the step as she left.</P>
<p>
Then she slipped through the hedge and
out to the path on the far side. A little way further on she suddenly
caught sight of a spacious desk standing in the midst of the heather.
An elderly man was sitting at it, apparently adding up figures.
Sophie went over to him and asked his name.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ebenezer Scrooge,&rdquo; he
said, poring over his ledgers again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;My name is Sophie. You are a
businessman, I presume?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He nodded. &ldquo;And immensely rich.
Not a penny must go to waste. That&rsquo;s why I have to concentrate
on my accounts.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why bother?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie waved and walked on. But she
had not gone many yards before she noticed a little girl sitting
quite alone under one of the tall trees. She was dressed in rags, and
looked pale and ill. As Sophie walked by, she thrust her hand into a
little bag and pulled out a box of matches.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Will you buy some matches?&rdquo;
she asked, holding them out to Sophie. Sophie felt in her pockets to
see if she had any money with her. Yes&mdash;she found a crown.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How much are they?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;One crown.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie gave the girl the coin and
stood there, with the box of matches in her hand.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are the first person to buy
anything from me for over a hundred years. Sometimes I starve to
death, and other times the frost does away with me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie thought it was perhaps not
surprising if the sale of matches was not especially brisk here in
the woods. But then she came to think of the businessman she had just
passed. There was no reason for the little match girl to die of
starvation when he was so wealthy.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
She took the girl&rsquo;s hand and
walked with her back to the rich man.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You must see to it that this
girl gets a better life,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
The man glanced up from his paperwork
and said: &ldquo;That kind of thing costs money, and I said not so
much as a penny must go to waste.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not fair that
you&rsquo;re so rich when this girl is so poor,&rdquo; insisted
Sophie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unjust!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Bah! Humbug! Justice only
exists between equals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I had to work my way up, and it
has paid off. Progress, they call it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t help me,
I&rsquo;ll die,&rdquo; said the poor girl.</P>
<p>
The businessman looked up again from
his ledgers. Then he threw his quill pen onto the table impatiently.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t figure in my
accounts! So&mdash;be off with you&mdash;to the poorhouse!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t help me,
I&rsquo;ll set fire to the woods,&rdquo; the girl persisted.</P>
<p>
That brought the man to his feet, but
the girl had already struck one of her matches. She held it to a
tuft of dry grass which flared up instantly.</P>
<p>
The man threw up his arms. &ldquo;God
help me!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The red cock has crowed!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The girl looked up at him with a
playful smile.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know I was a
communist, did you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The next minute, the girl, the
businessman, and the desk had disappeared. Sophie was once again
standing alone while the flames consumed the dry grass ever more
hungrily. It took her a while to put out the fire by stamping on
it.</P>
<p>
Thank goodness! Sophie glanced down at
the blackened grass. She was holding a box of matches in her
hand.</P>
<p>
She couldn&rsquo;t have started the
fire herself, could she?</P>
<p>
When she met Alberto outside the cabin
she told him what had happened.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Scrooge was the miserly
capitalist in A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens. You probably
remember the little match girl from the tale by Hans Christian
Andersen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to meet
them here in the woods.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not? These are no ordinary
woods, and now we are going to talk about Karl Marx. It is most
appropriate that you have witnessed an example of the tremendous
class struggles of the mid-nineteenth century. But let&rsquo;s go
inside. We are a little more protected from the major&rsquo;s
interference there.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Once again they sat at the little
table by the window facing the lake. Sophie could still feel all over
her body how she had experienced the little lake after having drunk
from the blue bottle.</P>
<p>
Today, both bottles were standing on
the mantelpiece. There was a miniature model of a Greek temple on the
table.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked
Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All in good time, my dear.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto began to talk: &ldquo;When
Kierkegaard went to Berlin in 1841, he might have sat next to
Karl Marx at Schel-ling&rsquo;s lectures. Kierkegaard had written a
master of arts thesis on Socrates. About the same time, Marx had
written a doctoral thesis on Democritus and Epicurus&mdash;in other
words, on the materialism of antiquity. Thus they had both staked out
the course of their own philosophies.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because Kierkegaard became an 
existentialist and Marx became a materialist?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Marx became what is known as a
historical materialist. But we&rsquo;ll come back to that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Each in his own way, both
Kierkegaard and Marx took Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy as their point of
departure. Both were influenced by Hegel&rsquo;s mode of thought, but
both rejected his &lsquo;world spirit,&rsquo; or his idealism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was probably too high-flown
for them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Definitely. In general, we
usually say that the era of the great philosophical systems ended
with Hegel. After him, philosophy took a new direction. Instead of
great speculative systems, we had what we call an existential
philosophy or a philosophy of action. This was what Marx meant when
he observed that until now, &lsquo;philosophers have only interpreted
the world in various ways; the point is to change it.&rsquo; These
words mark a significant turning point in the history of philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;After meeting Scrooge and the
little match girl, I have no problem understanding what Marx meant.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Marx&rsquo;s thinking had a
practical&mdash;or political&mdash;objective. He was not only a
philosopher; he was a historian, a sociologist, and an economist.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And he was a forerunner in all
these areas?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Certainly no other philosopher
had greater significance for practical politics. On the other
hand, we must be wary of identifying everything that calls itself
Marxism with Marx&rsquo;s own thinking. It is said of Marx that he
only became a Marxist in the mid-1840s, but even after that he could
at times feel it necessary to assert that he was not a Marxist.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was Jesus a Christian?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That, too, of course, is
debatable.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Carry on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Right from the start, his
friend and colleague Friedrich Engels contributed to what was
subsequently known as Marxism. In our own century, Lenin, Stalin, Mao
and many others also made their contribution to Marxism, or
Marxism-Leninism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I suggest we try to stick to
Marx himself. You said he was a historical materialist?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;He was not a philosophical
materialist like the atomists of antiquity nor did he advocate the
mechanical materialism of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. But he thought that, to a great extent, it was the
material factors in society which determined the way we think.
Material factors of that nature have certainly been decisive for
historical development.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was quite different from
Hegel&rsquo;s world spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hegel had pointed out that
historical development is driven by the tension between
opposites&mdash;which is then resolved by a sudden change. Marx
developed this idea further. But according to Marx, Hegel was
standing on his head.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not all the time, I hope.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hegel called the force that
drives history forward world spirit or world reason. This, Marx
claimed, is upside down. He wished to show that material changes are
the ones that affect history. &lsquo;Spiritual relations&rsquo; do
not create material change, it is the other way about. Material
change creates new spiritual relations. Marx particularly emphasized
that it was the economic forces in society that created change and
thus drove history forward.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you have an example?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Antiquity&rsquo;s philosophy
and science were purely theoretical in purpose. Nobody was
particularly interested in putting new discoveries into practice.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was because of the way the
economic life of the community was organized. Production was mainly
based on slave labor, so the citizens had no need to increase
production with practical innovations. This is an example of how
material relations help to affect philosophical reflection in
society.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Marx called these material,
economic, and social relations the basis of society. The way a
society thinks, what kind of political institutions there are, which
laws it has and, not least, what there is of religion, morals, art,
philosophy, and science, Marx called society&rsquo;s
superstructure.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Basis and superstructure,
right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;And now you will perhaps be
good enough to pass me the Greek temple.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie did so.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is a model of the
Parthenon temple on the Acropolis. You have also seen it in real
life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;On the video, you mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You can see that the
construction has a very elegant and elaborate roof. Probably the roof
with its front gable is what strikes one first. This is what we call
the superstructure.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But the roof cannot float in
thin air.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is supported by the
columns.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The building has very powerful
foundations&mdash;its bases&mdash;supporting the entire
construction. In the same way, Marx believed that material relations
support, so to speak, everything in the way of thoughts and ideas in
society. Society&rsquo;s superstructure is in fact a reflection of
the bases of that society.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you saying that Plato&rsquo;s
theory of ideas is a reflection of vase production and wine
growing?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that simple,
as Marx expressly points out. It is the interactive effect of
society&rsquo;s basis on its superstructure. If Marx had rejected
this interaction, he would have been a mechanical materialist. But
because Marx realized that there was an interactive or dialectic
relation between bases and superstructure, we say that he is a
dialectical materialist. By the way, you may care to note that Plato
was neither a potter nor a wine grower.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All right. Do you have any more
to say about the temple?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, a little. Could you
describe the bases of the temple?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The columns are standing on a
base that consists of three levels&mdash;or steps.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In the same manner we will
identify three levels in the bases of society. The most basic level
is what we may call society&rsquo;s conditions of production. In
other words, the natural conditions or resources that are
available to society. These are the foundation of any society, and
this foundation clearly determines the type of production in the
society, and by the same token, the nature of that society and its
culture in general.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have a herring
trade in the Sahara, or grow dates in northern Norway.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it. And the
way people think in a nomadic culture is very different from the way
they think in a fishing village in northern Norway The next level is
the society&rsquo;s means of production. By this Marx meant the
various kinds of equipment, tools, and machinery, as well as the raw
materials to be found there.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In the old days people rowed
out to the fishing grounds. Nowadays they use huge trawlers to catch
the fish.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and here you are talking
about the next level in the base of society, namely, those who own
the means of production. The division of labor, or the distribution
of work and ownership, was what Marx called society&rsquo;s
&lsquo;production relations.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So far we can conclude that it
is the mode of production in a society which determines which
political and ideological conditions are to be found there. It
is not by chance that today we think somewhat differently&mdash;and
have a somewhat different moral codex&mdash;from the old feudal
society.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So Marx didn&rsquo;t believe in
a natural right that was eternally valid.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, the question of what was
morally right, according to Marx, is a product of the base of
society. For example, it is not accidental that in the old peasant
society, parents would decide whom their children married. It was a
question of who was to inherit the farm. In a modern city,
social relations are different. Nowadays you can meet your future
spouse at a party or a disco, and if you are sufficiently in love,
you&rsquo;ll find somewhere to live.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I could never have put up with
my parents deciding who I was to marry.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s because you
are a child of your time. Marx emphasized moreover that it is mainly
society&rsquo;s ruling class that sets the norms for what is right or
wrong. Because &lsquo;the history of all hitherto existing societies
is the history of class struggles.&rsquo; In other words, history is
principally a matter of who is to own the means of production.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t people&rsquo;s
thoughts and ideas help to change history?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes and no. Marx understood
that conditions in society&rsquo;s superstructure could have an
interactive effect on the base of society, but he denied that
society&rsquo;s superstructure had any independent history of its
own. What has driven historical development from the slave society of
antiquity to the industrial society of today has primarily been
determined by changes in the base of society.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So you said.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Marx believed that in all
phases of history there has been a conflict between two dominant
classes of society. In antiquity&rsquo;s slave society, the
conflict was between free citizen and slave. In the feudal society of
the Middle Ages, it was between feudal lord and serf; later on,
between aristocrat and citizen. But in Marx&rsquo;s own time, in what
he called a bourgeois or capitalist society, the conflict was first
and foremost between the capitalists and the workers, or the
proletariat. So the conflict stood between those who own the means of
production and those who do not. And since the &lsquo;upper classes&rsquo;
do not voluntarily relinquish their power, change can only come about
through revolution.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What about a communist
society?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Marx was especially interested
in the transition from a capitalist to a communist society. He also
carried out a detailed analysis of the capitalist mode of production.
But before we look at that, we must say something about Marx&rsquo;s
view of man&rsquo;s labor.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Before he became a communist,
the young Marx was preoccupied with what happens to man when he
works. This was something Hegel had also analyzed. Hegel believed
there was an interactive, or dialectic, relationship between man and
nature. When man alters nature, he himself is altered. Or, to
put it slightly differently, when man works, he interacts with nature
and transforms it. But in the process nature also interacts with man
and transforms his consciousness.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me what you do and I&rsquo;ll
tell you who you are.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That, briefly, was Marx&rsquo;s
point. How we work affects our consciousness, but our consciousness
also affects the way we work. You could say it is an interactive
relationship between hand and consciousness. Thus the way you
think is closely connected to the job you do.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So it must be depressing to be
unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. A person who is unemployed
is, in a sense, empty. Hegel was aware of this early on. To both
Hegel and Marx, work was a positive thing, and was closely connected
with the essence of mankind.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So it must also be positive to
a worker?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, originally. But this is
precisely where Marx aimed his criticism of the capitalist method of
production.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Under the capitalist system,
the worker labors for someone else. His labor is thus something
external to him&mdash;or something that does not belong to him. The
worker becomes alien to his work&mdash;but at the same time also
alien to himself. He loses touch with his own reality. Marx says,
with a Hegelian expression, that the worker becomes alienated.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have an aunt who has worked
in a factory, packaging candy for over twenty years, so I can
easily understand what you mean. She says she hates going to
work, every single morning.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But if she hates her work,
Sophie, she must hate herself, in a sense.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She hates candy, that&rsquo;s
for sure.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In a capitalist society, labor
is organized in such a way that the worker in fact slaves for another
social class. Thus the worker transfers his own labor&mdash;and with
it, the whole of his life&mdash;to the bourgeoisie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it really that bad?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about Marx,
and we must therefore take our point of departure in the social
conditions during the middle of the last century. So the answer must
be a resounding yes. The worker could have a 12-hour working day
in a freezing cold production hall. The pay was often so poor that
children and expectant mothers also had to work. This led to
unspeakable social conditions. In many places, part of the wages was
paid out in the form of cheap liquor, and women were obliged to
supplement their earnings by prostitution. Their customers were the
respected citizenry of the town. In short, in the precise situation
that should have been the honorable hallmark of mankind, namely work,
the worker was turned into a beast of burden.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That infuriates me!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It infuriated Marx too. And
while it was happening, the children of the bourgeoisie played the
violin in warm, spacious living rooms after a refreshing bath. Or
they sat at the piano while waiting for their four-course dinner. The
violin and the piano could have served just as well as a diversion
after a long horseback ride.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ugh! How unjust!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Marx would have agreed.
Together with Engels, he published a Communist Manifesto in 1848. The
first sentence in this manifesto says: A spectre is haunting
Europe&mdash;the spectre of Communism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That sounds frightening.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It frightened the bourgeoisie
too. Because now the proletariat was beginning to revolt. Would
you like to hear how the Manifesto ends?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Communists disdain to
conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can
be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social
conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communist
revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their
chains. They have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries,
unite!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If conditions were as bad as
you say, I think I would have signed that Manifesto. But conditions
are surely a lot different today?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In Norway they are, but they
aren&rsquo;t everywhere. Many people still live under inhuman
conditions while they continue to produce commodities that make
capitalists richer and richer. Marx called this exploitation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Could you explain that word,
please?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;If a worker produces a
commodity, this commodity has a certain exchange-value.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you now deduct the workers&rsquo;
wages and the other production costs from the exchange-value, there
will always be a certain sum left over. This sum was what Marx
called profit. In other words, the capitalist pockets a value that
was actually created by the worker. That is what is meant by
exploitation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So now the capitalist invests
some of his profit in new capital&mdash;for instance, in modernizing
the production plant in the hope of producing his commodity even more
cheaply, and thereby increasing his profit in the future.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That sounds logical.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it can seem logical. But
both in this and in other areas, in the long term it will not go the
way the capitalist has imagined.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Marx believed there were a
number of inherent contradictions in the capitalist method of
production. Capitalism is an economic system which is
self-destructive because it lacks rational control.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, isn&rsquo;t
it, for the oppressed?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; it is inherent in the
capitalist system that it is marching toward its own destruction. In
that sense, capitalism is &lsquo;progressive&rsquo; because it
is a stage on the way to communism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you give an example of
capitalism being self-destructive?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We said that the capitalist had
a good surplus of money, and he uses part of this surplus to
modernize the factory. But he also spends money on violin lessons.
Moreover, his wife has become accustomed to a luxurious way of
life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No doubt.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He buys new machinery and so no
longer needs so many employees. He does this to increase his
competitive power.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I get it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But he is not the only one
thinking in this way, which means that production as a whole is
continually being made more effective. Factories become bigger and
bigger, and are gradually concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.
What happens then, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Er. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Fewer and fewer workers are
required, which means there are more and more unemployed. There are
therefore increasing social problems, and crises such as these are a
signal that capitalism is marching toward its own destruction.
But capitalism has a number of other self-destructive elements.
Whenever profit has to be tied up in the means of production without
leaving a big enough surplus to keep production going at competitive
prices . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;, . . what does the capitalist
do then? Can you tell me?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Imagine if you were a factory
owner. You cannot make ends meet. You cannot buy the raw materials
you need to keep producing. You are facing bankruptcy. So now my
question is, what can you do to economize?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe I could cut down on
wages?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Smart! Yes, that really is the
smartest thing you could do. But if all capitalists were as smart as
you&mdash;and they are&mdash;the workers would be so poor that they
couldn&rsquo;t afford to buy goods any more. We would say that
purchasing power is falling. And now we really are in a vicious
circle. The knell has sounded for capitalist private property, Marx
would say. We are rapidly approaching a revolutionary situation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To make a long story short, in
the end the proletariat rises and takes over the means of
production.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For a period, we get a new
&lsquo;class society&rsquo; in which the proletarians suppress the
bourgeoisie by force. Marx called this the dictatorship of the
proletariat. But after a transition period, the dictatorship of the
proletariat is replaced by a &lsquo;classless society,&rsquo; in
which the means of production are owned &lsquo;by all&rsquo;&mdash;that
is, by the people themselves. In this kind of society, the policy is
&lsquo;from each according to his abilities, to each according to his
needs.&rsquo; Moreover, labor now belongs to the workers themselves
and capitalism&rsquo;s alienation ceases.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It all sounds wonderful, but
what actually happened? Was there a revolution?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes and no. Today, economists
can establish that Marx was mistaken on a number of vital issues, not
least his analysis of the crises of capitalism. And he paid
insufficient attention to the plundering of the natural
environment&mdash;the serious consequences of which we are
experiencing today. Nevertheless . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nevertheless?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Marxism led to great upheavals.
There is no doubt that socialism has largely succeeded in combating
an inhumane society. In Europe, at any rate, we live in a
society with more justice&mdash;and more solidarity&mdash;than Marx
did. This is not least due to Marx himself and the entire socialist
movement.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;After Marx, the socialist
movement split into two main streams, Social Democracy and Leninism.
Social Democracy, which has stood for a gradual and peaceful
path in the direction of socialism, was Western Europe&rsquo;s way.
We might call this the slow revolution. Leninism, which retained
Marx&rsquo;s belief that revolution was the only way to combat the
old class society, had great influence in Eastern Europe, Asia,
and Africa. Each in their own way, both movements have fought against
hardship and oppression.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t it create a
new form of oppression? For example in Russia and Eastern
Europe?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No doubt of that, and here
again we see that everything man touches becomes a mixture of
good and evil. On the other hand, it would be unreasonable to blame
Marx for the negative factors in the so-called socialist countries
fifty or a hundred years after his death. But maybe he had given too
little thought to the people who would be the administrators of
communist society. There will probably never be a &lsquo;promised
land.&rsquo; Mankind will always create new problems to fight about.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And there we bring down the
curtain on Marx, Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hey, wait a minute! Didn&rsquo;t
you say something about justice only existing among equals?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, it was Scrooge who said
that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you know what he said?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh well&mdash;you and I have
the same author. In actual fact we are more closely linked to each
other than we would appear to the casual observer.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Your wretched irony again!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Double, Sophie, that was double
irony.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But back to justice. You said
that Marx thought capitalism was an unjust form of society. How
would you define a just society?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A moral philosopher called John
Rawls attempted to say something about it with the following example:
Imagine you were a member of a distinguished council whose task
it was to make all the laws for a future society.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind at all
being on that council.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They are obliged to consider
absolutely every detail, because as soon as they reach an
agreement&mdash;and everybody has signed the laws&mdash;they
will all drop dead.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But they will immediately come
to life again in the society they have legislated for. The point is
that they have no idea which position they will have in society.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That society would be a just
society. It would have arisen among equals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Men and women!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That goes without saying. None
of them knew whether they would wake up as men or women. Since the
odds are fifty-fifty, society would be just as attractive for women
as for men.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It sounds promising.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So tell me, was the Europe of
Karl Marx a society like that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Absolutely not!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But do you by any chance know
of such a society today?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Hm ... that&rsquo;s a good
question.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Think about it. But for now
there will be no more about Marx.&rdquo;

Hilde was awakened on Sunday morning by a loud bump. It was the ring
binder falling on the floor. She had been lying in bed reading about
Sophie and Alber-to&rsquo;s conversation on Marx and had fallen
asleep. The reading lamp by the bed had been on all night.</P>
<p>
The green glowing digits on her desk alarm clock showed 8:59.</P>
<p>
She had been dreaming about huge factories and polluted cities;
a little girl sitting at a street corner selling matches&mdash;well-dressed
people in long coats passing by without as much as a glance.</P>
<p>
When Hilde sat up in bed she remembered the legislators who were
to wake up in a society they themselves had created. Hilde was glad
she had woken up in Bjer-kely, at any rate.</P>
<p>
Would she have dared to wake up in Norway without knowing whereabouts
in Norway she would wake up?</P>
<p>
But it was not only a question of where she would wake up. Could she
not just as easily have woken up in a different age? In the Middle
Ages, for instance&mdash;or in the Stone Age ten or twenty thousand
years ago? Hilde tried to imagine herself sitting at the entrance to
a cave, scraping an animal hide, perhaps.</P>
<p>
What could it have been like to be a fifteen-year-old girl before
there was anything called a culture? How would she have thought?
Could she have had thoughts at all?</P>
<p>
Hilde pulled on a sweater, heaved the ring binder onto the bed and
settled down to read the next chapter.</P>
<p>
Alberto had just said &ldquo;Next
chapter!&rdquo; when somebody knocked on the door of the major&rsquo;s
cabin.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any choice,
do we?&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I suppose we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said Alberto.</P>
<p>
On the step outside stood a very old
man with long white hair and a beard. He held a staff in one hand,
and in the other a board on which was painted a picture of a boat The
boat was crowded with all kinds of animals. &ldquo;And who is this
elderly gentleman?&rdquo; asked Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;My name is Noah.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I guessed as much.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Your oldest ancestor, my son.
But it is probably no longer fashionable to recognize one&rsquo;s
ancestors.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is that in your hand?&rdquo;
asked Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is a picture of all the
animals that were saved from the Flood. Here, my daughter, it is for
you.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie took the large board.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d better go home
and tend the grapevines,&rdquo; the old man said, and giving a little
jump, he clicked his heels together in the air and skipped merrily
away into the woods in the manner peculiar to very old men now and
then.</P>
<p>
Sophie and Alberto went inside and sat
down again. Sophie began to look at the picture, but before she had a
chance to study it, Alberto took it from her with an authoritative
grasp.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll concentrate on the
broad outlines first.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, okay.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I forgot to mention that Marx
lived the last 34 years of his life in London. He moved there in 1849
and died in 1883. All that time Charles Darwin was living just
outside London. He died in 1882 and was buried with great pomp
and ceremony in Westminster Abbey as one of England&rsquo;s
distinguished sons. So Marx and Darwin&rsquo;s paths crossed, but not
only in time and space. Marx wanted to dedicate the English edition
of his greatest work, Capital, to Darwin, but Darwin declined the
honor. When Marx died the year after Darwin, his friend Friedrich
En-gels said: As Darwin discovered the theory of organic evolution,
so Marx discovered the theory of mankind&rsquo;s historical
evolution.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Another great thinker who was
to link his work to Darwin was the psychologist Sigmund Freud.
He also lived his last years in London. Freud said that both Darwin&rsquo;s
theory of evolution and his own psychoanalysis had resulted in
an affront to mankind&rsquo;s naive egoism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was a lot of names at one
time. Are we talking about Marx, Darwin, or Freud?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In a broader sense we can talk
about a naturalistic current from the middle of the nineteenth
century until quite far into our own. By &lsquo;naturalistic&rsquo;
we mean a sense of reality that accepts no other reality than nature
and the sensory world. A naturalist therefore also considers mankind
to be part of nature. A naturalistic scientist will exclusively rely
on natural phenomena&mdash;not on either rationalistic suppositions
or any form of divine revelation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that applies to Marx,
Darwin, and Freud?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Absolutely. The key words from
the middle of the last century were nature, environment, history,
evolution, and growth. Marx had pointed out that human ideologies
were a product of the basis of society. Darwin showed that mankind
was the result of a slow biological evolution, and Freud&rsquo;s
studies of the unconscious revealed that people&rsquo;s actions
were often the result of &lsquo;animal&rsquo; urges or instincts.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I understand more or
less what you mean by naturalistic, but isn&rsquo;t it best we talk
about one person at a time?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about Darwin,
Sophie. You may recall that the pre-Socratics looked for natural
explanations of the processes of nature. In the same way that they
had to distance themselves from ancient mythological explanations,
Darwin had to distance himself from the church&rsquo;s view of the
creation of man and beast.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But was he a real philosopher?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Darwin was a biologist and a
natural scientist. But he was also the scientist of recent times who
has most openly challenged the Biblical view of man&rsquo;s place in
Creation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll have to say
something about Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin with Darwin
the man. He was born in the little town of Shrewsbury in 1809. His
father, Dr. Robert Darwin, was a renowned local physician, and very
strict about his son&rsquo;s upbringing. When Charles was a pupil at
the local grammar school, his headmaster described him as a boy who
was always flying around, fooling about with stuff and nonsense, and
never doing a stroke of anything that was the slightest bit
useful. By &lsquo;useful,&rsquo; the headmaster meant cramming
Greek and Latin verbs. By &lsquo;flying around,&rsquo; he was
referring among other things to the fact that Charles clambered
around collecting beetles of all kinds.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he came to
regret those words.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When he subsequently studied
theology, Charles was far more interested in bird-watching and
collecting insects, so he did not get very good grades in theology.
But while he was still at college, he gained himself a reputation as
a natural scientist, not least due to his interest in geology, which
was perhaps the most expansive science of the day. As soon as he had
graduated in theology at Cambridge in April 1831, he went to
North Wales to study rock formations and to search for fossils. In
August of the same year, when he was barely twenty-two years old, he
received a letter which was to determine the course of his whole life
. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What was the letter about?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was from his friend and
teacher, John Steven Hens-low. He wrote: &lsquo;I have been requested
to ... recommend a naturalist to go as companion to Captain Fitzroy,
who has been commissioned by the government to survey the southern
coasts of South America. I have stated that I consider you to be
the best qualified person I know of who is likely to undertake such a
situation. As far as the financial side of it is concerned, I
have no notion. The voyage is to last two years ... &lsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How can you remember all that
by heart?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A bagatelle, Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;And what did he answer?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He wished ardently to grasp the
chance, but in those days young men did nothing without their
parents&rsquo; consent. After much persuasion, his father
finally agreed&mdash; and it was he who financed his son&rsquo;s
voyage. As far as the &lsquo;financial side&rsquo; went, it was
conspicuous by its absence.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The ship was the naval vessel
HMS Beagle. It sailed from Plymouth on December 27, 1831, bound for
South America, and it did not return until October of 1836. The two
years became five and the voyage to South America turned into a
voyage round the world. And now we come to one of the most important
voyages of discovery in recent times.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They sailed all the way round
the world?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, quite literally. From
South America they sailed on across the Pacific to New Zealand,
Australia, and South Africa. Then they sailed back to South America
before setting sail for England. Darwin wrote that the voyage on
board the Beagle was without doubt the most significant event in his
life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been
easy to be a naturalist at sea.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For the first years, the Beagle
sailed up and down the coast of South America. This gave Darwin
plenty of opportunity to familiarize himself with the continent,
also inland. The expedition&rsquo;s many forays into the
Galapagos Islands in the Pacific west of South America were of
decisive significance as well. He was able to collect and send
to England vast amounts of material. However, he kept his reflections
on nature and the evolution of life to himself. When he returned home
at the age of twenty-seven, he found himself renowned as a scientist.
At that point he had an inwardly clear picture of what was to become
his theory of evolution. But he did not publish his main work until
many years after his return, for Darwin was a cautious man&mdash;as
is fitting for a scientist.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What was his main work?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, there were several,
actually. But the book-which gave rise to the most heated debate in
England was The Origin of Species, published in 1859. Its full title
was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the
Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. The long
title is actually a complete resume of Darwin&rsquo;s theory.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He certainly packed a lot into
one title.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s take it piece
by piece. In The Origin of Species, Darwin advanced two theories
or main theses: first, he proposed that all existing vegetable and
animal forms were descended from earlier, more primitive forms by way
of a biological evolution. Secondly, that evolution was the result of
natural selection.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The survival of the fittest,
right?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but let us
first concentrate on the idea of evolution. This, in itself, was not
all that original. The idea of biological evolution began to be
widely accepted in some circles as early as 1800. The leading
spokesman for this idea was the French zoologist Lamarck. Even
before him, Darwin&rsquo;s own grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, had
suggested that plants and animals had evolved from some few primitive
species. But none of them had come up with an acceptable explanation
as to how this evolution happened. They were therefore not
considered by churchmen to be any great threat.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But Darwin was?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, indeed, and not without
reason. Both in ecclesiastic and scientific circles, the
Biblical doctrine of the immutability of all vegetable and
animal species was strictly adhered to. Each and every form of animal
life had been created separately once and for all. This Christian
view was moreover in harmony with the teachings of Plato and
Aristotle.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s theory of ideas
presupposed that all animal species were immutable because they were
made after patterns of eternal ideas or forms. The immutability of
animal species was also one of the cornerstones of Aristotle&rsquo;s
philosophy. But in Darwin&rsquo;s time there were a number of
observations and finds which were putting traditional beliefs to
the test.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What kind of observations and
finds were they?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, to begin with an
increasing number of fossils were being dug out. There were also
finds of large fossil bones from extinct animals. Darwin himself was
puzzled to find traces of sea creatures far inland. In South America
he made similar discoveries high up in the mountains of the Andes.
What is a sea creature doing in the Andes, Sophie? Can you tell me
that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Some believed that they had
just been thrown away there by humans or animals. Others believed
that God had created these fossils and traces of sea creatures to
lead the ungodly astray.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But what did scientists
believe?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Most geologists swore to a
&lsquo;catastrophe theory/ according to which the earth had been
subjected to gigantic floods, earthquakes, and other catastrophes
that had destroyed all life. We read of one of these in the
Bible&mdash;the Flood and Noah&rsquo;s Ark. After each catastrophe,
God renewed life on earth by creating new&mdash;and more
perfect&mdash; plants and animals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So the fossils were imprints of
earlier life forms that had been wiped out after these gigantic
catastrophes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Precisely. For example, it was
thought that fossils were imprints of animals that had failed to get
into the Ark. But when Darwin set sail on the Beagle, he had with him
the first volume of the English biologist Sir Charles Lyell&rsquo;s
Principles of Geology. Lyell held that the present geology of
the earth, with its mountains and valleys, was the result of an
interminably long and gradual evolution. His point was that even
quite small changes could cause huge geological upheavals,
considering the aeons of time that have elapsed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What kind of changes was he
thinking of?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He was thinking of the same
forces that prevail today: wind and weather, melting ice,
earthquakes, and elevations of the ground level. You&rsquo;ve
heard the saying about a drop of water wearing away a stone&mdash;not
by brute force, but by continuous dripping. Lyell believed that
similar tiny and gradual changes over the ages could alter the
face of nature completely. However, this theory alone could not
explain why Darwin found the remains of sea creatures high up in the
Andes. But Darwin always remembered that tiny gradual changes could
result in dramatic alterations if they were given sufficient
time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose he thought the same
explanation could be used for the evolution of animals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that was his thought. But
as I said before, Darwin was a cautious man. He posed questions long
before he ventured to answer them. In that sense he used the same
method as all true philosophers: it is important to ask but there is
no haste to provide the answer.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A decisive factor in Lyell&rsquo;s
theory was the age of the earth. In Darwin&rsquo;s time, it was
widely believed that about 6,000 years had elapsed since God created
the earth. That figure had been arrived at by counting the
generations since Adam and Eve.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How naive!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s easy to be
wise after the event. Darwin figured the age of the earth to be
300 million years. Because one thing, at least, was clear: neither
Lyell&rsquo;s theory of gradual geological evolution nor Darwin&rsquo;s
own theory of evolution had any validity unless one reckoned with
tremendously long periods of time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How old is the earth?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Today we know that the earth is
4.6 billion years old.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Up to now, we have looked at
one of Darwin&rsquo;s arguments for biological evolution,
namely, the stratified deposits of fossils in various layers of
rock. Another argument was the geographic distribution of living
species. This was where Darwin&rsquo;s scientific voyage could
contribute new and extremely comprehensive data. He had seen
with his own eyes that the individuals of a single species of animal
within the same region could differ from each other in only the
minutest detail. He made some very interesting observations on the
Galapagos Islands, west of Ecuador, in particular.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me about them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Galapagos Islands are a
compact group of volcanic islands. There were therefore no great
differences in the plant and animal life there. But Darwin was
interested in the tiny differences. On all the islands, he came
across giant tortoises that were slightly different from one island
to another. Had God really created a separate race of tortoises for
each and every island?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s doubtful.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s observations of
bird life on the Galapagos were even more striking. The Galapagos
finches were clearly varied from island to island, especially as
regards the shape of the beak. Darwin demonstrated that these
variations were closely linked to the way the finches found their
food on the different islands. The ground finches with steeply
profiled beaks lived on pine cone seeds, the little warbler finches
lived on insects, and the tree finches lived on termites extracted
from bark and branches ... Each and every one of the species had a
beak that was perfectly adapted to its own food intake. Could
all these finches be descended from one and the same species? And had
the finches adapted to their surroundings on the different islands
over the ages in such a way that new species of finches evolved?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was the conclusion he came
to, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Maybe that was where
Darwin became a &lsquo;Darwinist&rsquo;&mdash;on the Galapagos
Islands. He also observed that the fauna there bore a strong
resemblance to many of the species he had seen in South America. Had
God once and for all really created all these animals slightly
different from each other&mdash;or had an evolution taken place?
Increasingly, he began to doubt that all species were
immutable. But he still had no viable explanation as to how such
an evolution had occurred. But there was one more factor to indicate
that all the animals on earth might be related.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And what was that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The development of the embryo
in mammals. If you compare the embryos of dogs, bats, rabbits, and
humans at an early stage, they look so alike that it is hard to tell
the difference. You cannot distinguish a human embryo from a rabbit
embryo until a very late stage. Shouldn&rsquo;t this indicate that we
are distant relatives?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But he had still no explanation
of how evolution happened?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He pondered constantly on
[yell&rsquo;s theory of the minute changes that could have great
effect over a long period of time. But he could find no explanation
that would apply as a general principle. He was familiar with the
theory of the French zoologist Lamarck, who had shown that the
different species had developed the characteristics they needed.
Giraffes, for example, had developed long necks because for
generations they had reached up for leaves in the trees. Lamarck
believed that the characteristics each individual acquires through
his own efforts are passed on to the next generation. But this theory
of the heredity of &lsquo;acquired characteristics&rsquo; was
rejected by Darwin because Lamarck had no proof of his bold
claims. However, Darwin was beginning to pursue another, much more
obvious line of thought. You could almost say that the actual
mechanism behind the evolution of species was right in front of his
very nose.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So what was it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I would rather you worked the
mechanism out for yourself. So I ask: If you had three cows, but
only enough fodder to keep two of them alive, what would you do?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;d have to
slaughter one of them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All right... which one would
you slaughter?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;d slaughter
the one that gave the least milk.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s logical,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is exactly what mankind
had done for thousands of years. But we haven&rsquo;t finished with
your two cows yet. Suppose you wanted one of them to calve. Which one
would you choose?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The one that was the best
milker. Then its calf would probably be a good milker too.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You prefer good milkers to bad,
then. Now there&rsquo;s one more question. If you were a hunter and
you had two gundogs, but had to give up one of them, which one would
you keep?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The one that&rsquo;s best at
finding the kind of game I shoot, obviously.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite so, you would favor the
better gundog. That&rsquo;s exactly how people have bred domestic
animals for more than ten thousand years, Sophie. Hens did not always
lay five eggs a week, sheep did not always yield as much wool, and
horses were not always as strong and swift as they are now. Breeders
have made an artificial selection. The same applies to the vegetable
kingdom. You don&rsquo;t plant bad potatoes if there are good seed
potatoes available, and you don&rsquo;t waste time cutting wheat
that yields no grain. Darwin pointed out that no cows, no stalks of
wheat, no dogs, and no finches are completely alike. Nature
produces an enormous breadth of variation. Even within the same
species, no two individuals are exactly alike. You probably
experienced that for yourself when you drank the blue liquid.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So now Darwin had to ask
himself: could a similar mechanism be at work in nature too? Is it
possible that nature makes a &lsquo;natural selection&rsquo; as to
which individuals are to survive? And could such a selection over a
very long period of time create new species of flora and fauna?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I would guess the answer is
yes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Darwin could still not quite
imagine how such a natural selection could take place. But in
October 1838, exactly two years after his return on the Beagle,
he chanced to come across a little book by the specialist in
population studies, Thomas Malthus. The book was called An Essay on
the Principle of Population. Malthus got the idea for this essay from
Benjamin Franklin, the American who invented the lightning
conductor among other things. Franklin had made the point that
if there were no limiting factors in nature, one single species of
plant or animal would spread over the entire globe. But because there
are many species, they keep each other in balance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can see that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Malthus developed this idea and
applied it to the world&rsquo;s population. He believed that
mankind&rsquo;s ability to procreate is so great that there are
always more children born than can survive. Since the production of
food can never keep pace with the increase in population, he
believed that huge numbers were destined to succumb in the
struggle for existence. Those who survived to grow up&mdash; and
perpetuate the race&mdash;would therefore be those who came out best
in the struggle for survival.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That sounds logical.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But this was actually the
universal mechanism that Darwin had been searching for. Here was
the explanation of how evolution happens. It was due to natural
selection in the struggle for life, in which those that were best
adapted to their surroundings would survive and perpetuate the race.
This was the second theory which he proposed in The Origin of
Species. He wrote: The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder
of all known animals,&rsquo; but if it had six young and survived to
a hundred, &lsquo;after a period of from 740 to 750 years there would
be nearly nineteen million elephants alive, descended from the first
pair.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not to mention all the
thousands of cods&rsquo; eggs from a single cod.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Darwin further proposed that
the struggle for survival is frequently hardest among species that
resemble each other the most. They have to fight for the same food.
There, the slightest advantage&mdash;that is to say, the
infinitesimal variation&mdash;truly comes into its own. The more
bitter the struggle for survival, the quicker will be the evolution
of new species, so that only the very best adapted will survive
and the others will die out.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The less food there is and the
bigger the brood, the quicker evolution happens?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s not only a
question of food. It can be just as vital to avoid being eaten by
other animals. For example, it can be a matter of survival to have a
protective camouflage, the ability to run swiftly, to recognize
hostile animals, or, if the worst comes to the worst, to have a
repellent taste. A poison that can kill predators is quite useful
too. That&rsquo;s why so many cacti are poisonous, Sophie.
Practically nothing else can grow in the desert, so this plant
is especially vulnerable to plant-eating animals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Most cacti are prickly as
well.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The ability to reproduce is
also of fundamental importance, obviously. Darwin studied the
ingenuity of plant pollination in great detail. Flowers glow in
glorious hues and exude delirious scents to attract the insects which
are instrumental in pollination. To perpetuate their kind, birds
trill their melodious tones. A placid or melancholy bull with no
interest in cows will have no interest for genealogy either, since
with characteristics like these, its line will die out at once. The
bull&rsquo;s sole purpose in life is to grow to sexual maturity and
reproduce in order to propagate the race. It is rather like a relay
race. Those that for one reason or another are unable to pass on
their genes are continually discarded, and in that way the race
is continually refined. Resistance to disease is one of the most
important characteristics progressively accumulated and preserved in
the variants that survive.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So everything gets better and
better?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The result of this continual
selection is that the ones best adapted to a particular
environment&mdash;or a particular ecological niche&mdash;will in the
long term perpetuate the race in that environment. But what is an
advantage in one environment is not necessarily an advantage in
another. For some of the Galapagos finches, the ability to fly was
vital. But being good at flying is not so necessary if food is dug
from the ground and there are no predators. The reason why so many
different animal species have arisen over the ages is precisely
because of these many niches in the natural environment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But even so, there is only one
human race.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because man has a
unique ability to adapt to different conditions of life. One of the
things that amazed Darwin most was the way the Indians in Tierra del
Fuego managed to live under such terrible climatic conditions. But
that doesn&rsquo;t mean that all human beings are alike. Those who
live near the equator have darker skins than people in the more
northerly climes because their dark skin protects them from the sun.
White people who expose themselves to the sun for long periods are
more prone to skin cancer.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it a similar advantage to
have white skin if you live in northern countries?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, otherwise everyone on
earth would be dark-skinned. But white skin more easily forms sun
vitamins, and that can be vital in areas with very little sun.
Nowadays that is not so important because we can make sure we
have enough sun vitamins in our diet. But nothing in nature is
random. Everything is due to infinitesimal changes that have taken
effect over countless generations.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Actually, it&rsquo;s quite
fantastic to imagine.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is indeed. So far, then, we
can sum up Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution in a few sentences.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We can say that the &lsquo;raw
material&rsquo; behind the evolution of life on earth was the
continual variation of individuals within the same species, plus
the large number of progeny, which meant that only a fraction of them
survived, the actual &lsquo;mechanism,&rsquo; or driving force,
behind evolution was thus the natural selection in the struggle for
survival. This selection ensured that the strongest, or the
&lsquo;fittest,&rsquo; survived.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It seems as logical as a math
sum. How was The Origin of Species received?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was the cause of bitter
controversies. The Church protested vehemently and the scientific
world was sharply divided. That was not really so surprising. Darwin
had, after all, distanced God a good way from the act of creation,
although there were admittedly some who claimed it was surely greater
to have created something with its own innate evolutionary potential
than simply to create a fixed entity.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Suddenly Sophie jumped up from her
chair.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Look out there!&rdquo; she
cried.</P>
<p>
She pointed out of the window. Down by
the lake a man and a woman were walking hand in hand. They were
completely naked.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Adam and Eve,&rdquo;
said Alberto. &ldquo;They were gradually forced to throw in their lot
with Little Red Rid-inghood and Alice in Wonderland. That&rsquo;s why
they have turned up here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie went to the window to watch
them, but they soon disappeared among the trees.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because Darwin believed that
mankind was descended from animals?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In 1871 Darwin published The
Descent of Man, in which he drew attention to the great similarities
between humans and animals, advancing the theory that men and
anthropoid apes must at one time have evolved from the same
progenitor. By this time the first fossil skulls of an extinct type
of man had been found, first in the Rock of Gibraltar and some years
later in Neanderthal in Germany. Strangely enough, there were
fewer protests in T871 than in 1859, when Darwin published The Origin
of Species. But man&rsquo;s descent from animals had been implicit
in the first book as well. And as I said, when Darwin died in 1882,
he was buried with all the ceremony due to a pioneer of science.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&rdquo;So in the end he found honor
and dignity?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Eventually, yes. But not before
he had been described as the most dangerous man in England.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo; &lsquo;Let us hope it is not
true,&rsquo; wrote an upper-class lady, &lsquo;but if it is, let us
hope it will not be generally known.&rsquo; A distinguished scientist
expressed a similar thought: &lsquo;An embarrassing discovery, and
the less said about it the better.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was almost proof that man
is related to the ostrich!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Good point. But that&rsquo;s
easy enough for us to say now. People were suddenly obliged to revise
their whole approach to the Book of Genesis. The young writer
John Ruskin put it like this: &lsquo;If only the geologists would
leave me alone. After each Bible verse I hear the blows of their
hammers.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And the blows of the hammers
were his doubts about the word of God?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was presumably what he
meant. Because it was more than the literal interpretation of the
story of creation that toppled. The essence of Darwin&rsquo;s theory
was the utterly random variations which had finally produced
Man. And what was more, Darwin had turned Marv into a product of
something as unsentimental as the struggle for existence.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did Darwin have anything to say
about how such random variations arose?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put your finger on
the weakest point in his theory. Darwin had only the vaguest
idea of heredity. Something happens in the crossing. A father and
mother never get two identical offspring. There is always some slight
difference. On the other hand it&rsquo;s difficult to produce
anything really new in that way. Moreover, there are plants and
animals which reproduce by budding or by simple cell division. On the
question of how the variations arise, Darwin&rsquo;s theory has been
supplemented by the so-called neo-Darwinism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All life and all reproduction
is basically a matter of cell division. When a cell divides into two,
two identical cells are produced with exactly the same hereditary
factors. In cell division, then, we say a cell copies itself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But occasionally, infinitesimal
errors occur in the process, so that the copied cell is not
exactly the same as the mother cell. In modern biological terms, this
is a mutation. Mutations are either totally irrelevant, or they can
lead to marked changes in the behavior of the individual. They can be
directly harmful, and such &lsquo;mutants&rsquo; will be continually
discarded from the large broods. Many diseases are in fact due to
mutations. But sometimes a mutation can give an individual just that
extra positive characteristic needed to hold its own in the struggle
for existence.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like a longer neck, for
instance?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Lamarck&rsquo;s explanation of
why the giraffe has such a long neck was that giraffes have always
had to reach upwards. But according to Darwinism, no such inherited
characteristic would be passed on. Darwin believed that the giraffe&rsquo;s
long neck was the result of a variation. Neo-Darwinism supplemented
this by showing a clear cause of just that particular variation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Mutations?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Absolutely random changes
in hereditary factors supplied one of the giraffe&rsquo;s ancestors
with a slightly longer neck than average. When there was a limited
supply of food, this could be vital enough. The giraffe that
could reach up highest in the trees managed best. We can also imagine
how some such &lsquo;primal giraffes&rsquo; evolved the ability to
dig in the ground for food. Over a very long period of time, an
animal species, now long extinct, could have divided itself into two
species. We can take some more recent examples of the way natural
selection can work.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In Britain there is a certain
species of butterfly called the peppered moth, which lives on the
trunks of silver birches. Back in the eighteenth century, most
peppered moths were silvery gray. Can you guess why, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So they weren&rsquo;t so easy
for hungry birds to spot.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But from time to time, due to
quite chance mutations, some darker ones were born. How do you think
these darker variants fared?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They were easier to see, so
they were more easily snapped up by hungry birds.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, because in that
environment&mdash;where the birch trunks were silver&mdash;the darker
hue was an unfavorable characteristic. So it was always the paler
peppered moths that increased in number. But then something happened
in that environment. In several places, the silvery trunks became
blackened by industrial soot. What do you think happened to the
peppered moths then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;the darker ones survived best.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, so now it wasn&rsquo;t
long before they increased in number. From 1848 to 1948, the
proportion of dark peppered moths increased from 1 to 99 percent
in certain places. The environment had changed, and it was no longer
an advantage to be light. On the contrary. The white &lsquo;losers&rsquo;
were weeded out with the help of the birds as soon as they appeared
on the birch trunks. But then something significant happened again. A
decrease in the use of coal and better filtering equipment in the
factories has recently produced a cleaner environment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So now the birches are silver
again?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And therefore the peppered moth
is in the process of returning to its silvery color. This is what we
call adaptation. It&rsquo;s a natural law.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But there are numerous examples
of how man interferes in the environment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For example, people have tried
to eradicate pests with various pesticides. At first, this can
produce excellent results. But when you spray a field or an orchard
with pesticides, you actually cause a miniature ecocatastrophe
for the pests you are trying to eradicate. Due to continual
mutations, a type of pest develops that is resistant to the pesticide
being used. Now these &lsquo;winners&rsquo; have free play, so it
becomes harder and harder to combat certain kinds of pest simply
because of man&rsquo;s attempt to eradicate them. The most resistant
variants are the ones that survive, of course.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty scary.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It certainly is food for
thought. We also try to combat parasites in our own bodies in the
form of bacteria.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We use penicillin or other
kinds of antibiotic.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and penicillin is also an
ecocatastrophe for the little devils. However, as we continue to
administer penicillin, we are making certain bacteria resistant,
thereby cultivating a group of bacteria that is much harder to
combat than it was before. We find we have to use stronger and
stronger antibiotics, until . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Until they finally crawl out of
our mouths? Maybe we ought to start shooting them?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That might be a tiny bit
exaggerated. But it is clear that modern medicine has created a
serious dilemma. The problem is not only that a single bacterium has
become more virulent. In the past, there were many children who never
survived&mdash;they succumbed to various diseases. Sometimes only the
minority survived. But in a sense modern medicine has put
natural selection out of commission. Something that has helped one
individual over a serious illness can in the long run contribute to
weakening the resistance of the whole human race to certain diseases.
If we pay absolutely no attention to what is called hereditary
hygiene, we could find ourselves facing a degeneration of the human
race. Mankind&rsquo;s hereditary potential for resisting serious
disease will be weakened.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a terrifying prospect!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But a real philosopher must not
refrain from pointing out something &lsquo;terrifying&rsquo; if he
otherwise believes it to be true. So let us attempt another summary.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You could say that life is one
big lottery in which only the winning numbers are visible.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Those that have lost in the
struggle for existence have disappeared, you see. It takes many
millions of years to select the winning numbers for each and every
species of vegetable and animal on the earth. And the losing
numbers&mdash;well, they only make one appearance. So there are
no species of animal or vegetable in existence today that are not
winning numbers in the great lottery of life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because only the best have
survived.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s another way
of saying it. And now, if you will kindly pass me the picture which
that fellow&mdash;that zookeeper&mdash;brought us . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie passed the picture over to him.
The picture of Noah&rsquo;s Ark covered one side of it. The other was
devoted to a tree diagram of all the various species of animals. This
was the side Alberto was now showing her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Our Darwinian Noah also brought
us a sketch that shows the distribution of the various vegetable and
animal species. You can see how the different species belong in the
different groups, classes, and subkingdoms.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Together with monkeys, man
belongs to the so-called primates. Primates are mammals, and all
mammals belong to the vertebrates, which again belong to the
multi-cellular animals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like
Aristotle.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. But the
sketch illustrates not only the distribution of the different species
today. It also tells something of the history of evolution. You can
see, for example, that birds at some point parted from reptiles, and
that reptiles at some point parted from amphibia, and that amphibia
parted from fishes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very clear.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Every time a line divides into
two, it&rsquo;s because mutations have resulted in a new
species. That is how, over the ages, the different classes and
subkingdoms of animals arose. In actual fact there are more than
a million animal species in the world today, and this million is only
a fraction of the species that have at some time lived on the earth.
You can see, for instance, that an animal group such as the Trilobita
is totally extinct.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And at the bottom are the
monocellular animals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Some of these may not have
changed in two billion years. You can also see that there is a line
from these monocellular organisms to the vegetable kingdom. Because
in all probability plants come from the same primal cell as animals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see that. But there&rsquo;s
something that puzzles me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Where did this first primal
cell come from? Did Darwin have any answer to that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I said, did I not, that he was
a very cautious man. But as regards that question, he did permit
himself to propose what one might call a qualified guess. He wrote:</P>
<p>
If (and O, what an if!) we could
picture some hot little pool in which all manner of ammoniacal and
phosphorous salts, light, heat, electricity and so forth were
present, and that a protein compound were to be chemically formed in
it, ready to undergo even more complicated changes ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What Darwin was philosophizing
on here was how the first living cell might have been formed out of
inorganic matter. And again, he hit the nail right on the head.
Scientists of today think the first primitive form of life arose in
precisely the kind of &lsquo;hot little pool&rsquo; that Darwin
pictured.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That will have to suffice
because we&rsquo;re leaving Darwin now. We&rsquo;re going to jump
ahead to the most recent findings about the origins of life on
earth.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather apprehensive.
Does anybody really know how life began?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe not, but more and more
pieces of the puzzle have fallen into place to form a picture of how
it may have begun.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us first establish that all
life on earth&mdash;both animal and vegetable&mdash;is constructed of
exactly the same substances. The simplest definition of life is that
it is a substance which in a nutrient solution has the ability
to subdivide itself into two identical parts. This process is
governed by a substance we call DNA. By DNA we mean the chromosomes,
or hereditary structures, that are found in all living cells. We also
use the term DNA molecule, because DNA is in fact a complex
molecule&mdash;or macro-molecule. The question is, then, how the
first molecule arose.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The earth was formed when the
solar system came into being 4.6 billion years ago. It began as a
glowing mass which gradually cooled. This is where modern science
believes life began between three and four billion years ago.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It sounds totally improbable.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that before you
have heard the rest. First of all, our planet was quite different
from the way it looks today. Since there was no life, there was no
oxygen in the atmosphere. Free oxygen was first formed by the
photosynthesis of plants. And the fact that there was no oxygen
is important. It is unlikely that life cells&mdash;which, again, can
form DNA&mdash;could have arisen in an atmosphere containing
oxygen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because oxygen is strongly
reactive. Long before complex molecules like DNA could be
formed, the DNA molecular cells would be oxydized.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Really.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is how we know for certain
that no new life arises today, not even so much as a bacterium or a
virus. All life on earth must be exactly the same age. An elephant
has just as long a family tree as the smallest bacterium. You could
almost say that an elephant&mdash;or a human being&mdash; is in
reality a single coherent colony of monocellular creatures.
Because each cell in our body carries the same hereditary material.
The whole recipe of who we are lies hidden in each tiny cell.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an odd thought.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;One of life&rsquo;s great
mysteries is that the cells of a multicellular animal have the
ability to specialize their function in spite of the fact that not
all the different hereditary characteristics are active in all the
cells. Some of these characteristics&mdash;or genes&mdash;are
&lsquo;activated&rsquo; and others are &lsquo;deactivated.&rsquo; A
liver cell does not produce the same proteins as a nerve cell or
a skin cell. But all three types of cell have the same DMA molecule,
which contains the whole recipe for the organism in question.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Since there was no oxygen in
the atmosphere, there was no protective ozone layer around the earth.
That means there was nothing to stop the radiation from the cosmos.
This is also significant because this radiation was probably
instrumental in forming the first complex molecule. Cosmic
radiation of this nature was the actual energy which caused the
various chemical substances on the earth to start combining into a
complicated macro-molecule.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me recapitulate: Before
such complex molecules, of which all life consists, can be formed, at
least two conditions must be present: there must be no oxygen in
the atmosphere, and there must be access for cosmic radiation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I get it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In this &lsquo;hot little
pool&rsquo;&mdash;or primal soup, as it is often called by modern
scientists&mdash;there was once formed a gigantically
complicated macromolecule, which had the wondrous property of being
able to subdivide itself into two identical parts. And so the long
evolutionary process began, Sophie. If we simplify it a bit, we can
say that we are now talking of the first hereditary material, the
first DNA or the first living cell. It subdivided itself again and
again&mdash;but from the very first stage, transmutation was
occurring. After aeons of time, one of these monocellular organisms
connected with a more complicated multicel-lular organism. Thus the
photosynthesis of plants also began, and in that way the
atmosphere came to contain oxygen. This had two results: first, the
atmosphere permitted the evolution of animals that could breathe
with the aid of lungs. Secondly, the atmosphere protected life from
the harmful cosmic radiation. Strangely enough, this radiation,
which was probably a vital &lsquo;spark&rsquo; in the formation of
the first cell, is also harmful to all forms of life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But the atmosphere can&rsquo;t
have been formed overnight. How did the earliest forms of life
manage?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Life began in the primal
&lsquo;seas&rsquo;&mdash;which are what we mean by primal soup. There
it could live protected from the harmful rays. Not until much later,
when life in the oceans had formed an atmosphere, did the first
amphibians crawl out onto land. The rest is what we have already
talked about. And here we are, sitting in a hut in the woods, looking
back on a process that has taken three or four billion years. And in
us, this long process has finally become aware of itself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet you don&rsquo;t think
it all happened quite accidentally?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I never said that. The picture
on this board shows that evolution had a direction. Across the aeons
of time animals have evolved with increasingly complicated nerve
systems&mdash;and an ever bigger brain. Personally, I don&rsquo;t
think that can be accidental. What do you think?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be pure chance
that created the human eye. Don&rsquo;t you think there is meaning in
our being able to see the world around us?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Funnily enough, the development
of the eye puzzled Darwin too. He couldn&rsquo;t really come to terms
with the fact that something as delicate and sensitive as an eye
could be exclusively due to natural selection.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie sat looking up at Alberto. She
was thinking how odd it was that she should be alive now, and that
she only lived this one time and would never again return to life.
Suddenly she exclaimed:</P>
<p>
What matters our creative endless
toil, 
</P>
<p>
When, at a snatch, oblivion ends the
coil?</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Alberto frowned at her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You must not talk like that,
child. Those are the words of the Devil.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Devil?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Or Mephistopheles&mdash;in
Goethe&rsquo;s Faust &lsquo;Was soil uns denn das ew&rsquo;ge
Schaffen! Geschaffenes zu nichts hinweg-zuraffenV &ldquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;But what do those words mean
exactly?&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;As Faust dies and looks back on
his life&rsquo;s work, he says in triumph:</P>
<p>
Then to the moment could I say:</P>
<p>
Linger you now, you are so fair!</P>
<p>
Now records of my earthly day</P>
<p>
No flights of aeons can impair&mdash;</P>
<p>
Foreknowledge comes, and fills me with
such bliss,</P>
<p>
I take my joy, my highest moment
this.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was very poetic.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But then it&rsquo;s the Devil&rsquo;s
turn. As soon as Faust dies, he exclaims:</P>
<p>
A foolish word, bygone.</P>
<p>
How so then, gone?</P>
<p>
Gone, to sheer Nothing, past with null
made one!</P>
<p>
What matters creative endless toil,</P>
<p>
When, at a snatch, oblivion ends the
coil?</P>
<p>
&lsquo;It is bygone&rsquo;&mdash;How
shall this riddle run?</P>
<p>
As good as if things never had begun,</P>
<p>
Yet circle back, existence to possess:</P>
<p>
I&rsquo;d rather have Eternal
Emptiness.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pessimistic. I
liked the first passage best. Even though his life was over, Faust
saw some meaning in the traces he would leave behind him.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And is it not also a
consequence of Darwin&rsquo;s theory that we are part of something
all-encompassing, in which every tiny life form has its significance
in the big picture? We are the living planet, Sophie! We are the
great vessel sailing around a burning sun in the universe. But each
and every one of us is also a ship sailing through life with a cargo
of genes. When we have carried this cargo safely to the next
harbor&mdash;we have not lived in vain. Thomas Hardy expresses the
same thought in his poem Transformations&rsquo;:</P>
<p>
Portion of this yew</P>
<p>
Is a man my grandsire knew,</P>
<p>
Bosomed here at its foot: 
</P>
<p>
This branch may be his wife, 
</P>
<p>
A ruddy human life 
</P>
<p>
Now turned to a green shoot.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
These grasses must be made 
</P>
<p>
Of her who often prayed, 
</P>
<p>
Last century, for repose; 
</P>
<p>
And the fair girl long ago 
</P>
<p>
Whom I often tried to know 
</P>
<p>
May be entering this rose.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
So, they are not underground, 
</P>
<p>
But as nerves and veins abound 
</P>
<p>
In the growths of upper air, 
</P>
<p>
And they feel the sun and rain, 
</P>
<p>
And the energy again 
</P>
<p>
That made them what they were!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very pretty.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But we will talk no more. I
simply say next chapter!&rsquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, stop all that irony!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;New chapter, I said! I shall be
obeyed!&rdquo;</P>

</P>
<br /><h3>Freud</h3><br />
<p>
... the odious egoistic impulse that had emerged in her...</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Hilde Moller Knag jumped out of bed with the bulky ring binder in her
arms. She plonked it down on her writing desk, grabbed her clothes,
and dashed into the bathroom. She stood under the shower for two
minutes, dressed herself quickly, and ran downstairs.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Breakfast is ready, Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I just have to go and row first.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But Hilde... !&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She ran out of the house, down the garden, and out onto the little
dock. She untied the boat and jumped down into it. She rowed around
the bay with short angry strokes until she had calmed down.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We are the living planet, Sophie! We are the great vessel
sailing around a burning sun in the universe. But each and every of
us is also a ship sailing through life with a cargo of genes. When we
have carried this cargo safely to the next harbor&mdash;we have not
lived in vain...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She knew the passage by heart. It had been written for her. Not for
Sophie, for her. Every word in the ring binder was written by Dad to
Hilde.</P>
<p>
She rested the oars in the oarlocks and drew them in. The boat rocked
gently on the water, the ripples slapping softly against the prow.</P>
<p>
And like the little rowboat floating on the surface in the bay at
Lillesand, she herself was just a nutshell on the surface of life.</P>
<p>
Where were Sophie and Alberto in this picture? Yes, where were
Alberto and Sophie?</P>
<p>
She could not fathom that they were no more than &ldquo;electromagnetic
impulses&rdquo; in her father&rsquo;s brain. She could not fathom,
and certainly not accept, that they were only paper and printer&rsquo;s
ink from a ribbon in her father&rsquo;s portable typewriter. One
might just as well say that she herself was nothing but a
conglomeration of protein compounds that had suddenly come to life
one day in a &ldquo;hot little pool.&rdquo; But she was more than
that. She was Hilde Moller Knag.</P>
<p>
She had to admit that the ring binder was a fantastic present, and
that her father had touched the core of something eternal in her. But
she didn&rsquo;t care for the way he was dealing with Sophie and
Alberto.</P>
<p>
She would certainly teach him a lesson, even before he got home. She
felt she owed it to the two of them. Hilde could already imagine her
father at Kastrup Airport, in Copenhagen. She could just see him
running around like mad.</P>
<p>
Hilde was now quite herself again. She rowed the boat back to the
dock, where she was careful to make it fast. After breakfast she sat
at the table for a long time with her mother. It felt good to be able
to talk about something as ordinary as whether the egg was a trifle
too soft.</P>
<p>
She did not start to read again until the evening. There were not
many pages left now.</P>
<p>
Once again there was a knocking on the
door.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just put our hands
over our ears,&rdquo; said Alberto, &ldquo;and perhaps it&rsquo;ll go
away.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I want to see who it is.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto followed her to the door.</P>
<p>
On the step stood a naked man. He had
adopted a very ceremonial posture, but the only thing he had with him
was the crown on his head.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What
do you good people think of the Emperor&rsquo;s new clothes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto and Sophie were utterly
dumbfounded. This caused the naked man some consternation.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What? You are not bowing!&rdquo;
he cried.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, that is true,&rdquo;
said Alberto, &ldquo;but the Emperor is stark naked.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The naked man maintained his
ceremonial posture. Alberto bent over and whispered in Sophie&rsquo;s
ear:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He thinks he is respectable.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
At this, the man scowled.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is some kind of censorship
being exercised on these premises?&rdquo; he asked.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Regrettably,&rdquo; said
Alberto. &ldquo;In here we are both alert and of sound mind in every
way. In the Emperor&rsquo;s shameless condition he can therefore
not cross the threshold of this house.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie found the naked man&rsquo;s
pomposity so absurd that she burst out laughing. As if her laughter
had been a prearranged signal, the man with the crown on his head
suddenly became aware that he was naked. Covering his private parts
with both hands, he bounded toward the nearest clump of trees and
disappeared, probably to join company with Adam and Eve, Noah, Little
Red Riding-hood, and Winnie-the-Pooh.</P>
<p>
Alberto and Sophie remained standing
on the step, laughing.</P>
<p>
At last Alberto said, &ldquo;It might
be a good idea if we went inside. I&rsquo;m going to tell you about
Freud and his theory of the unconscious.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They seated themselves by the window
again. Sophie looked at her watch and said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s already
half past two and I have a lot to do before the garden party.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So have I. We&rsquo;ll just say
a few words about Sigmund Freud.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was he a philosopher?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We could describe him as a
cultural philosopher, at least. Freud was born in 1 856 and he
studied medicine at the University of Vienna. He lived in Vienna for
the greater part of his life at a period when the cultural life of
the city was flourishing. He specialized early on in neurology.
Toward the close of the last century, and far into our own, he
developed his &lsquo;depth psychology&rsquo; or psychoanalysis.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to explain
this, right?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Psychoanalysis is a description
of the human mind in general as well as a therapy for nervous and
mental disorders. I do not intend to give you a complete picture
either of Freud or of his work. But his theory of the unconscious
is necessary to an understanding of what a human being is.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You intrigue me. Go on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Freud held that there is a
constant tension between man and his surroundings. In particular, a
tension&mdash;or conflict&mdash;between his drives and needs and the
demands of society. It is no exaggeration to say that Freud
discovered human drives. This makes him an important exponent of
the naturalistic currents that were so prominent toward the end of
the nineteenth century.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by human
drives?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Our actions are not always
guided by reason. Man is not really such a rational creature as the
eighteenth-century rationalists liked to think. Irrational impulses
often determine what we think, what we dream, and what we do. Such
irrational impulses can be an expression of basic drives or needs.
The human sexual drive, for example, is just as basic as the baby&rsquo;s
instinct to suckle.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This in itself was no new
discovery. But Freud showed that these basic needs can be disguised
or &lsquo;sublimated,&rsquo; thereby steering our actions without our
being aware of it. He also showed that infants have some sort of
sexuality. The respectable middle-class Viennese reacted with
abhorrence to this suggestion of the &lsquo;sexuality of the
child&rsquo; and made him very unpopular.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We call it Victorianism, when
everything to do with sexuality is taboo. Freud first became aware of
children&rsquo;s sexuality during his practice of psychotherapy. So
he had an empirical basis for his claims. He had also seen how
numerous forms of neurosis or psychological disorders could be traced
back to conflicts during childhood. He gradually developed a type of
therapy that we could call the archeology of the soul.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;An archeologist searches for
traces of the distant past by digging through layers of cultural
history. He may find a knife from the eighteenth century. Deeper in
the ground he may find a comb from the fourteenth century&mdash;and
even deeper down perhaps an urn from the fifth century</P>
<p>
B.C.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In a similar way, the
psychoanalyst, with the patient&rsquo;s help, can dig deep into the
patient&rsquo;s mind and bring to light the experiences that have
caused the patient&rsquo;s psychological disorder, since
according to Freud, we store the memory of all our experiences deep
inside us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The analyst can perhaps
discover an unhappy experience that the patient has tried to
suppress for many years, but which has nevertheless lain buried,
gnawing away at the patient&rsquo;s resources. By bringing a
&lsquo;traumatic experience&rsquo; into the conscious mind&mdash;and
holding it up to the patient, so to speak&mdash;he or she can help
the patient &lsquo;be done with it,&rsquo; and get well again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That sounds logical.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I am jumping too far ahead.
Let us first take a look at Freud&rsquo;s description of the human
mind. Have you ever seen a newborn baby?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have a cousin who is four.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When we come into the world, we
live out our physical and mental needs quite directly and
unashamedly. If we do not get milk, we cry, or maybe we cry if we
have a wet diaper. We also give direct expression to our desire for
physical contact and body warmth. Freud called this &lsquo;pleasure
principle&rsquo; in us the id. As newborn babies we are hardly
anything but id.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We carry the id, or pleasure
principle, with us into adulthood and throughout life. But gradually
we learn to regulate our desires and adjust to our surroundings. We
learn to regulate the pleasure principle in relation to the &lsquo;reality
principle.&rsquo; In Freud&rsquo;s terms, we develop an ego which has
this regulative function. Even though we want or need something, we
cannot just lie down and scream until we get what we want or need.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, obviously.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We may desire something very
badly that the outside world will not accept. We may repress our
desires. That means we try to push them away and forget about them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;However, Freud proposed, and
worked with, a third element in the human mind. From infancy we are
constantly faced with the moral demands of our parents and of
society. When we do anything wrong, our parents say &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
do that!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Naughty naughty, that&rsquo;s bad!&rsquo;
Even when we are grown up, we retain the echo of such moral demands
and judgments. It seems as though the world&rsquo;s moral
expectations have become part of us. Freud called this the superego.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that another word for
conscience?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Conscience is a component of
the superego. But Freud claimed that the superego tells us when our
desires themselves are &lsquo;bad&rsquo; or &lsquo;improper/ not
least in the case of erotic or sexual desire. And as I said, Freud
claimed that these &lsquo;improper&rsquo; desires already manifest
themselves at an early stage of childhood.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nowadays we know that infants
like touching their sex organs. We can observe this on any beach. In
Freud&rsquo;s time, this behavior could result in a slap over the
fingers of the two- or three-year-old, perhaps accompanied by the
mother saying, &lsquo;Naughty!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Keep your hands on top of the covers!&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How sick!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beginning of
guilt feelings about everything connected with the sex organs and
sexuality. Because this guilt feeling remains in the superego, many
people&mdash;according to Freud, most people&mdash;feel guilty
about sex all their lives. At the same time he showed that sexual
desires and needs are natural and vital for human beings. And thus,
my dear Sophie, the stage is set for a lifelong conflict between
desire and guilt.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the
conflict has died down a lot since Freud&rsquo;s time?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Most certainly. But many of
Freud&rsquo;s patients experienced the conflict so acutely that
they developed what Freud called neuroses. One of his many women
patients, for example, was secretly in love with her brother-in-law.
When her sister died of an illness, she thought: &lsquo;Now he is
free to marry me!&rsquo; This thought was on course for a frontal
collision with her superego, and was so monstrous an idea that she
immediately repressed it, Freud tells us. In other words, she buried
it deep in her unconscious. Freud wrote: &lsquo;The young girl was
ill and displaying severe hysterical symptoms. When I began treating
her it appeared that she had thoroughly forgotten about the
scene at her sister&rsquo;s bedside and the odious egoistic impulse
that had emerged in her. But during analysis she remembered it, and
in a state of great agitation she reproduced the pathogenic moment
and through this treatment became cured.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now I better understand what
you meant by an archeology of the soul.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So we can give a general
description of the human psyche. After many years of experience in
treating patients, Freud concluded that the conscious
constitutes only a small part of the human mind. The conscious is
like the tip of the iceberg above sea level. Below sea level&mdash;or
below the threshold of the conscious&mdash;is the &lsquo;subconscious,&rsquo;
or the unconscious.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So the unconscious is
everything that&rsquo;s inside us that we have forgotten and don&rsquo;t
remember?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have all our
experiences consciously present all the time. But the kinds of things
we have thought or experienced, and which we can recall if we &lsquo;put
our mind to it,&rsquo; Freud termed the preconscious. He reserved the
term &lsquo;unconscious&rsquo; for things we have repressed. That is,
the sort of thing we have made an effort to forget because it was
either &lsquo;unpleasant&rsquo;,&rsquo;improper,&rsquo; or &lsquo;nasty.&rsquo;
If we have desires and urges that are not tolerable to the conscious,
the superego shoves them downstairs. Away with them!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I get it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This mechanism is at work in
all healthy people. But it can be such a tremendous strain for some
people to keep the unpleasant or forbidden thoughts away from
consciousness that it leads to mental illness. Whatever is
repressed in this way will try of its own accord to reenter
consciousness. For some people it takes a great effort to keep such
impulses under the critical eye of the conscious. When Freud was in
America in 1909 lecturing on psychoanalysis, he gave an example
of the way this repression mechanism functions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear that!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;Suppose that
here in this hall and in this audience, whose exemplary stillness and
attention I cannot sufficiently commend, there is an individual
who is creating a disturbance, and, by his ill-bred laughing,
talking, by scraping his feet, distracts my attention from my
task. I explain that I cannot go on with my lecture under these
conditions, and thereupon several strong men among you get up and,
after a short struggle, eject the disturber of the peace from the
hall. He is now repressed, and I can continue my lecture. But in
order that the disturbance may not be repeated, in case the man
who has just been thrown out attempts to force his way back into the
room, the gentlemen who have executed my suggestion take their
chairs to the door and establish themselves there as a resistance, to
keep up the repression. Now, if you transfer both locations to the
psyche, calling this consciousness, and the outside the
unconscious, you have a tolerably good illustration of the process of
repression.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But the disturber of the peace
insists on reentering, Sophie. At least, that&rsquo;s the way it is
with repressed thoughts and urges. We live under the constant
pressure of repressed thoughts that are trying to fight their way up
from the unconscious. That&rsquo;s why we often say or do things
without intending to. Unconscious reactions thus prompt our feelings
and actions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you give me an example?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Freud operates with several of
these mechanisms. One is what he called parapraxes&mdash;slips of the
tongue or pen. In other words, we accidentally say or do things that
we once tried to repress. Freud gives the example of the shop foreman
who was to propose a toast to the boss. The trouble was that this
boss was terribly unpopular. In plain words, he was what one might
call a swine.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The foreman stood up, raised
his glass, and said &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to the swine!&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m speechless!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So was the foreman. He had
actually only said what he really meant. But he didn&rsquo;t mean to
say it. Do you want to hear another example?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A bishop was coming to tea with
the local minister, who had a large family of nice well-behaved
little daughters. This bishop happened to have an unusually big
nose. The little girls were duly instructed that on no account were
they to refer to the bishop&rsquo;s nose, since children often blurt
out spontaneous remarks about people because their repressive
mechanism is not yet developed. The bishop arrived, and the
delightful daughters strained themselves to the utmost not to comment
on his nose. They tried to not even look at it and to forget about
it. But they were thinking about it the whole time. And then one
of them was asked to pass the sugar around. She looked at the
distinguished bishop and said, &lsquo;Do you take sugar in your
nose?&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How awful!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Another thing we can do is to
rationalize. That means that we do not give the real reason for what
we are doing either to ourselves or to other people because the real
reason is unacceptable.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I could hypnotize you to open a
window. While you are under hypnosis I tell you that when I begin to
drum my fingers on the table you will get up and open the window.
I drum on the table&mdash;and you open the window. Afterward I ask
you why you opened the window and you might say you did it because it
was too hot. But that is not the real reason. You are reluctant to
admit to yourself that you did something under my hypnotic orders. So
you rationalize.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;We all encounter that sort of
thing practically every day.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This four-year-old cousin of
mine, I don&rsquo;t think he has a lot of playmates, so he&rsquo;s
always happy when I visit. One day I told him I had to hurry home to
my mom. Do you know what he said?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He said, she&rsquo;s stupid!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that was definitely a case
of rationalizing. The boy didn&rsquo;t mean what he actually said. He
meant it was stupid you had to go, but he was too shy to say so.
Another thing we do is project.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When we project, we transfer
the characteristics we are trying to repress in ourselves onto other
people. A person who is very miserly, for example, will characterize
others as penny-pinchers. And someone who will not admit to
being preoccupied with sex can be the first to be incensed at other
people&rsquo;s sex-fixation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Freud claimed that our everyday
life was filled with unconscious mechanisms like these. We forget a
particular person&rsquo;s name, we fumble with our clothes while
we talk, or we shift what appear to be random objects around in the
room. We also stumble over words and make various slips of the
tongue or pen that can seem completely innocent. Freud&rsquo;s point
was that these slips are neither as accidental nor as innocent as we
think. These bungled actions can in fact reveal the most intimate
secrets.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;From now on I&rsquo;ll watch
all my words very carefully.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Even if you do, you won&rsquo;t
be able to escape from your unconscious impulses. The art is
precisely not to expend too much effort on burying unpleasant things
in the unconscious. It&rsquo;s like trying to block up the
entrance to a water vole&rsquo;s nest. You can be sure the water vole
will pop up in another part of the garden. It is actually quite
healthy to leave the door ajar between the conscious and the
unconscious.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you lock that door you can
get mentally sick, right?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. A neurotic is just such a
person, who uses too much energy trying to keep the &lsquo;unpleasant&rsquo;
out of his consciousness. Frequently there is a particular experience
which the person is desperately trying to repress. He can nonetheless
be anxious for the doctor to help him to find his way back to the
hidden traumas.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How does the doctor do that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Freud developed a technique
which he called free association. In other words, he let the patient
lie in a relaxed position and just talk about whatever came into his
or her mind&mdash;however irrelevant, random, unpleasant, or
embarrassing it might sound. The idea was to break through the
&lsquo;lid&rsquo; or &lsquo;control&rsquo; that had grown over the
traumas, because it was these traumas that were causing the
patient concern. They are active all the time, just not
consciously.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The harder you try to forget
something, the more you think about it unconsciously?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly. That is why it is so
important to be aware of the signals from the unconscious. According
to Freud, the royal road to the unconscious is our dreams. His main
work was written on this subject&mdash;The Interpretation of Dreams,
published in 1900, in which he showed that our dreams are not random.
Our unconscious tries to communicate with our conscious through
dreams.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;After many years of experience
with patients&mdash;and not least after having analyzed his own
dreams&mdash;Freud determined that all dreams are wish
fulfillments. This is clearly observable in children, he said. They
dream about ice cream and cherries. But in adults, the wishes that
are to be fulfilled in dreams are disguised. That is because even
when we sleep, censorship is at work on what we will permit
ourselves. And although this censorship, or repression
mechanism, is considerably weaker when we are asleep than when we are
awake, it is still strong enough to cause our dreams to distort the
wishes we cannot acknowledge.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Which is why dreams have to be
interpreted &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Freud showed that we must
distinguish between the actual dream as we recall it in the morning
and the real meaning of the dream. He termed the actual dream
image&mdash;that is, the &lsquo;film&rsquo; or &lsquo;video&rsquo;
we dream&mdash;the manifest dream. This &lsquo;apparent&rsquo; dream
content always takes its material or scenario from the previous
day. But the dream also contains a deeper meaning which is hidden
from consciousness. Freud called this the latent dream thoughts, and
these hidden thoughts which the dream is really about may stem from
the distant past, from earliest childhood, for instance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So we have to analyze the dream
before we can understand it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and for the mentally ill,
this must be done in conjunction with the therapist. But it is
not the doctor who interprets the dream. He can only do it with the
help of the patient. In this situation, the doctor simply fulfills
the function of a Socratic &lsquo;midwife,&rsquo; assisting during
the interpretation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The actual process of
converting the latent dream thoughts to the manifest dream aspect was
termed by Freud the dream work. We might call it &lsquo;masking&rsquo;
or &lsquo;coding&rsquo; what the dream is actually about. In
interpreting the dream, we must go through the reverse process and
unmask or decode the motif to arrive at its theme.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you give me an example?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Freud&rsquo;s book teems with
examples. But we can construct a simple and very Freudian
example for ourselves. Let us say a young man dreams that he is given
two balloons by his female cousin . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on, try to interpret the
dream yourself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hmm ... there is a manifest
dream, just like you said: a young man gets two balloons from his
female cousin.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Carry on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You said the scenario is always
from the previous day. So he had been to the fair the day before&mdash;or
maybe he saw a picture of balloons in the newspaper.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible, but he
need only have seen the word &lsquo;balloon,&rsquo; or something that
reminded him of a balloon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But what are the latent dream
thoughts that the dream is really about?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the interpreter.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe he just wanted a couple
of balloons.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t work.
You&rsquo;re right about the dream being a wish fulfillment. But a
young man would hardly have an ardent wish for a couple of balloons.
And if he had, he wouldn&rsquo;t need to dream about them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve got it: he
really wants his cousin&mdash;and the two balloons are her breasts.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a much more
likely explanation. And it presupposes that he experienced his
wish as an embarrassment.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In a way, our dreams make a lot
of detours?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Freud believed that the
dream was a &lsquo;disguised fulfillment of a repressed wish.&rsquo;
But exactly what we have repressed can have changed considerably
since Freud was a doctor in Vienna. However, the mechanism of
disguised dream content can still be intact.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Freud&rsquo;s psychoanalysis
was extremely important in the 1920s, especially for the treatment of
certain psychiatric patients. His theory of the unconscious was also
very significant for art and literature.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Artists became interested in
people&rsquo;s unconscious mental life?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly so, although this had
already become a predominant aspect of literature in the last
decade of the nineteenth century&mdash;before Freud&rsquo;s
psychoanalysis was known. It merely shows that the appearance of
Freud&rsquo;s psychoanalysis at that particular time, the 1890s, was
no coincidence.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You mean it was in the spirit
of the times?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Freud himself did not claim to
have discovered phenomena such as repression, defense
mechanisms, or rationalizing. He was simply the first to apply
these human experiences to psychiatry. He was also a master at
illustrating his theories with literary examples. But as I
mentioned, from the 1920s, Freud&rsquo;s psychoanalysis had a
more direct influence on art and literature &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In what sense?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Poets and painters, especially
the surrealists, attempted to exploit the power of the
unconscious in their work.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What are surrealists?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;The word surrealism comes from
the French, and means &lsquo;super realism.&rsquo; In 1924 Andre
Breton published a &lsquo;surrealistic manifesto,&rsquo; claiming
that art should come from the unconscious. The artist should thus
derive the freest possible inspiration from his dream images and
strive toward a &lsquo;super realism,&rsquo; in which the boundaries
between dream and reality were dissolved. For an artist too it
can be necessary to break the censorship of the conscious and
let words and images have free play.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can see that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In a sense, Freud demonstrated
that there is an artist in everyone. A dream is, after all, a little
work of art, and there are new dreams every night. In order to
interpret his patients&rsquo; dreams, Freud often had to work his way
through a dense language of symbols&mdash;rather in the way we
interpret a picture or a literary text.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And we dream every single
night?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Recent research shows that we
dream for about twenty percent of our sleeping hours, that is,
between one and two hours each- night. If we are disturbed during our
dream phases we become nervous and irritable. This means nothing less
than that everybody has an innate need to give artistic expression to
his or her existential situation. After all, it is ourselves that our
dreams are about We are the directors, we set up the scenario and
play all the roles. A person who says he doesn&rsquo;t understand
art doesn&rsquo;t know himself very well.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Freud also delivered impressive
evidence of the wonders of the human mind. His work with
patients convinced him that we retain everything we have seen and
experienced somewhere deep in our consciousness, and all these
impressions can be brought to light again. When we experience a
memory lapse, and a bit later &lsquo;have it on the tip of our
tongue&rsquo; and then later still &lsquo;suddenly remember it,&rsquo;
we are talking about something which has lain in the unconscious and
suddenly slips through the half-open door to consciousness.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it takes a while
sometimes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All artists are aware of that.
But then suddenly it&rsquo;s as if all doors and all drawers fly
open. Everything comes tumbling out by itself, and we can find all
the words and images we need. This is when we have &lsquo;lifted the
lid&rsquo; of the unconscious. We can call it inspiration, Sophie. It
feels as if what we are drawing or writing is coming from some
outside source.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It must be a wonderful
feeling.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you must have experienced
it yourself. You can frequently observe inspiration at work in
children who are overtired. They are sometimes so extremely overtired
that they seem to be wide awake. Suddenly they start telling a
story&mdash;as if they are finding words they haven&rsquo;t yet
learned. They have, though; the words and the ideas have lain
&lsquo;latent&rsquo; in their consciousness, but now, when all
caution and all censorship have let go, they are surfacing. It
can also be important for an artist not to let reason and reflection
control a more or less unconscious expression. Shall I tell you a
little story to illustrate this?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very serious and a
very sad story.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Once upon a time there was a
centipede that was amazingly good at dancing with all hundred legs.
All the creatures of the forest gathered to watch every time the
centipede danced, and they were all duly impressed by the exquisite
dance. But there was one creature that didn&rsquo;t like watching the
centipede dance&mdash;that was a tortoise.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was probably just envious.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How can I get the centipede to
stop dancing? thought the tortoise. He couldn&rsquo;t just say he
didn&rsquo;t like the dance. Neither could he say he danced better
himself, that would obviously be untrue. So he devised a fiendish
plan.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He sat down and wrote a letter
to the centipede. &lsquo;O incomparable centipede,&rsquo; he wrote,
&lsquo;I am a devoted admirer of your exquisite dancing. I must
know how you go about it when you dance. Is it that you lift your
left leg number 28 and then your right leg number 39? Or do you begin
by lifting your right leg number 17 before you lift your left leg
number 44? I await your answer in breathless anticipation. Yours
truly, Tortoise.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How mean!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;When the centipede read the
letter, she immediately began to think about what she actually did
when she danced. Which leg did she lift first? And which leg next?
What do you think happened in the end?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The centipede never danced
again?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what
happened. And that&rsquo;s the way it goes when imagination gets
strangled by reasoned deliberation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was a sad story.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is important for an artist
to be able to &lsquo;let go.&rsquo; The surrealists tried to exploit
this by putting themselves into a state where things just happened by
themselves. They had a sheet of white paper in front of them and they
began to write without thinking about what they wrote. They called it
automatic writing. The expression originally comes from spiritualism,
where a medium believed that a departed spirit was guiding the pen.
But I thought we would talk more about that kind of thing tomorrow.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In one sense, the surrealist
artist is also a medium, that is to say, a means or a link. He is a
medium of his own unconscious. But perhaps there is an element of the
unconscious in every creative process, for what do we actually
mean by creativity?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. Isn&rsquo;t
it when you create something?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Fair enough, and that happens
in a delicate interplay between imagination and reason. But all too
frequently, reason throttles the imagination, and that&rsquo;s
serious because without imagination, nothing really new will
ever be created. I believe imagination is like a Darwinian system.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but that I
didn&rsquo;t get.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Darwinism holds that
nature&rsquo;s mutants arise one after the other, but only a few of
them can be used. Only some of them get the right to live.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it is when we
have an inspiration and get masses of new ideas. Thought-mutants
occur in the consciousness one after the other, at least if we
refrain from censoring ourselves too much. But only some of these
thoughts can be used. Here, reason comes into its own.</P>
<p>
It, too, has a vital function. When
the day&rsquo;s catch is laid on the table we must not forget to be
selective.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a bad
comparison.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Imagine if everything that
&lsquo;strikes us&rsquo; were allowed to pass our lips! Not to speak
of jumping off our notepads out of our desk drawers! The world would
sink under the weight of casual impulses and no selection would have
taken place.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s reason that
chooses between all these ideas?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t you think so?
Maybe the imagination creates what is new, but the imagination
does not make the actual selection. The imagination does not
&lsquo;compose.&rsquo; A composition&mdash;and every work of art is
one&mdash;is created in a wondrous interplay between imagination and
reason, or between mind and reflection. For there will always be an
element of chance in the creative process. You have to turn the sheep
loose before you can start to herd them.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto sat quite still, staring out
of the window. While he sat there, Sophie suddenly noticed a crowd of
brightly colored Disney figures down by the lake.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Goofy,&rdquo; she
exclaimed, &ldquo;and Donald Duck and his nephews ... Look, Alberto.
There&rsquo;s Mickey Mouse and . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He turned toward her: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s
very sad, child.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Here we are being made the
helpless victims of the major&rsquo;s flock of sheep. But it&rsquo;s
my own fault, of course. I was the one who started talking about free
association of ideas.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You certainly don&rsquo;t have
to blame yourself...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I was going to say something
about the importance of imagination to us philosophers. In order to
think new thoughts, we must be bold enough to let ourselves go. But
right now, he&rsquo;s going a bit far.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I was about to mention the
importance of reflection, and here we are, presented with this lurid
imbecility. He should be ashamed of himself!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you being ironic now?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s he who is ironic,
not me. But I have one comfort&mdash;and that is the whole
cornerstone of my plan.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m really confused.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We have talked about dreams.
There&rsquo;s a touch of irony about that too. For what are we but
the major&rsquo;s dream images?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But there is still one thing he
hasn&rsquo;t counted on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe he is embarrassingly
aware of his own dream. He is aware of everything we say and do&mdash;just
as the dreamer remembers the dream&rsquo;s manifest dream aspect. It
is he who wields it with his pen. But even if he remembers
everything we say to each other, he is still not quite awake.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He does not know the latent
dream thoughts, Sophie. He forgets that this too is a disguised
dream.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are talking so strangely.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The major thinks so too. That
is because he does not understand his own dream language. Let us be
thankful for that. That gives us a tiny bit of elbow room, you see.
And with this elbow room we shall soon fight our way out of his muddy
consciousness like water voles frisking about in the sun on a
summer&rsquo;s day.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll make
it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We must. Within a couple of
days I shall give you a new horizon. Then the major will no longer
know where the water voles are or where they will pop up next time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But even if we are only dream
images, I am still my mother&rsquo;s daughter. And it&rsquo;s five
o&rsquo;clock. I have to go home to Captain&rsquo;s Bend and prepare
for the garden party.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hmm ... can you do me a small
favor on the way home?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Try to attract a little extra
attention. Try to get the major to keep his eye on you all the way
home. Try and think about him when you get home&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll
think about you too.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What good will that do?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I can carry on undisturbed
with my work on the secret plan. I&rsquo;m going to dive down into
the major&rsquo;s unconscious. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll be
until we meet again.&rdquo;</P>

<p>
The alarm clock showed 11:55 p.m. Hilde lay staring at the ceiling.
She tried to let her associations flow freely. Each time she finished
a chain of thoughts, she tried to ask herself why.</P>
<p>
Could there be something she was trying to repress?</P>
<p>
If only she could have set aside all censorship, she might have slid
into a waking dream. A bit scary, she thought.</P>
<p>
The more she relaxed and opened herself to random thoughts and
images, the more she felt as if she was in the major&rsquo;s cabin by
the little lake in the woods.</P>
<p>
What could Alberto be planning? Of course, it was Hilde&rsquo;s
father planning that Alberto was planning something. Did he already
know what Alberto would do? Perhaps he was trying to give himself
free rein, so that whatever happened in the end would come as a
surprise to him too.</P>
<p>
There were not many pages left now. Should she take a peek at the
last page? No, that would be cheating. And besides, Hilde was
convinced that it was far from decided what was to happen on the
last page.</P>
<p>
Wasn&rsquo;t that a curious thought? The ring binder was right here
and her father could not possibly get back in time to add anything to
it. Not unless Alberto did something on his own. A surprise ...</P>
<p>
Hilde had a few surprises up her own sleeve, in any case. Her father
did not control her. But was she in full control of herself?</P>
<p>
What was consciousness? Wasn&rsquo;t it one of the greatest riddles
of the universe? What was memory? What made us &ldquo;remember&rdquo;
everything we had seen and experienced?</P>
<p>
What kind of mechanism made us create fabulous dreams night after
night?</P>
<p>
She closed her eyes from time to time. Then she opened them and
stared at the ceiling again. At last she forgot to open them.</P>
<p>
She was asleep.</P>
<p>
When the raucous scream of a seagull woke her, Hilde got out of bed.
As usual, she crossed the room to the window and stood looking out
across the bay. It had gotten to be a habit, summer and winter.</P>
<p>
As she stood there, she suddenly felt a myriad of colors
exploding in her head. She remembered what she had dreamt. But it
felt like more than an ordinary dream, with its vivid colors and
shapes ...</P>
<p>
She had dreamt that her father came home from Lebanon, and the
whole dream was an extension of Sophie&rsquo;s dream when she found
the gold crucifix on the dock.</P>
<p>
Hilde was sitting on the edge of the dock&mdash;exactly as in
Sophie&rsquo;s dream. Then she heard a very soft voice whispering,
&ldquo;My name is Sophie!&rdquo; Hilde had stayed where she was,
sitting very still, trying to hear where the voice was coming from.
It continued, an almost inaudible rustling, as if an insect were
speaking to her: &ldquo;You must be both deaf and blind!&rdquo; Just
then her father had come into the garden in his UN uniform. &ldquo;Hilde!&rdquo;
he shouted. Hilde ran up to him and threw her arms around his neck.
That&rsquo;s where the dream ended.</P>
<p>
She remembered some lines of a poem by Arnulf 0verland:</P>
<p>
Wakened one night by a curious dream</P>
<p>
and a voice that seemed to be speaking to me</P>
<p>
like a far-off subterranean stream,</P>
<p>
I rose and asked: What do you want of me?</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
She was still standing at the window when her mother came in.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hi there! Are you already awake?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be home around four, as usual.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, Mom.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Have a nice vacation day, Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You have a good day too.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
When she heard her mother slam the front door, she slipped back into
bed with the ring binder.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to dive down into the major&rsquo;s
unconscious. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll be until we meet
again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
There, yes. Hilde started reading again. She could feel under her
right index finger that there were only a few pages left.</P>
<p>
When Sophie left the major&rsquo;s
cabin, she could still see some of the Disney figures at the water&rsquo;s
edge, but they seemed to dissolve as she approached them. By the time
she reached the boat they had all disappeared.</P>
<p>
While she was rowing she made faces,
and after she had pulled the boat up into the reeds on the other side
she waved her arms about. She was working desperately to hold the
major&rsquo;s attention so that Alberto could sit undisturbed in
the cabin.</P>
<p>
She danced along the path, hopping and
skipping. Then she tried walking like a mechanical doll. To keep the
major interested she began to sing as well. At one point she stood
still, pondering what Alberta&rsquo;s plan could be. Catching
herself, she got such a bad conscience that she started to climb a
tree.</P>
<p>
Sophie climbed as high as she could.
When she was nearly at the top, she realized she could not get down.
She decided to wait a little before trying again. But meanwhile she
could not just stay quietly where she was. Then the major would get
tired of watching her and would begin to interest himself in what
Alberto was doing.</P>
<p>
Sophie waved her arms, tried to crow
like a rooster a couple of times, and finally began to yodel. It was
the first time in her fifteen-year-old life that Sophie had yodeled.</P>
<p>
All things considered, she was quite
pleased with the result.</P>
<p>
She tried once more to climb down but
she was truly stuck. Suddenly a huge goose landed on one of the
branches Sophie was clinging to. Having recently seen a whole swarm
of Disney figures, Sophie was not in the least surprised when the
goose began to speak.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;My name is Morten,&rdquo; said
the goose. &ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;m a tame goose, but on this
special occasion I have flown up from Lebanon with the wild geese.
You look as if you could use some help getting down from this tree.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are much too small to help
me,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are jumping to conclusions,
young lady. It is you who are too big.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same thing,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I would have you know I carried
a peasant boy exactly your age all over Sweden. His name was
Nils Hol-gersson.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am fifteen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And Nils was fourteen. A year
one way or the other makes no difference to the freight.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How did you manage to lift
him?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I gave him a little slap and he
passed out. When he woke up, he was no bigger than a thumb.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you could give me a
little slap too, because I can&rsquo;t sit up here forever. And I&rsquo;m
giving a philosophical garden party on Saturday.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting. I
presume this is a philosophy book, then. When I was flying over
Sweden with Nils Holgers-son, we touched down on Marbacka in
Varmland, where Nils met an old woman who was planning to write a
book about Sweden for schoolchildren. It was to be both instructive
and true, she said. When she heard about Nils&rsquo;s adventures,
she decided to write a book about all the things he had seen on
gooseback.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was very strange.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To tell you the truth it was
rather ironic, because we were already in that book.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Suddenly Sophie felt something slap
her cheek and the next minute she had become no bigger than a thumb.
The tree was like a whole forest and the goose was as big as a horse.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said the
goose.</P>
<p>
Sophie walked along the branch and
climbed up on the goose&rsquo;s back. Its feathers were soft, but now
that she was so small, they pricked her more than they tickled.</P>
<p>
As soon as she had settled comfortably
the goose took off. They flew high above the treetops. Sophie looked
down at the lake and the major&rsquo;s cabin. Inside sat Al-berto,
laying his devious plans.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A short sightseeing tour will
have to be sufficient today,&rdquo; said the goose, flapping its
wings again and again.</P>
<p>
With that, it flew in to land at the
foot of the tree which Sophie had so recently begun to climb. As the
goose touched down Sophie tumbled onto the ground. After rolling
around in the heather a few times, she sat up. She realized with
amazement that she was her full size again.</P>
<p>
The goose waddled around her a few
times.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thanks a lot for your help,&rdquo;
said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was a mere bagatelle. Did
you say this was a philosophy book?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s what you
said.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh well, it&rsquo;s all the
same. If it had been up to me, I would have liked to fly you through
the whole history of philosophy just as I flew Nils Holgersson
through Sweden. We could have circled over Miletus and Athens,
Jerusalem and Alexandria, Rome and Florence, London and Paris,
Jena and Heidelberg, Berlin and Copenhagen . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thanks, that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But flying across the centuries
would have been a hefty job even for a very ironic goose. Crossing
the Swedish provinces is far easier.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
So saying, the goose ran a few steps
and flapped itself into the air.</P>
<p>
Sophie was exhausted, but when she
crawled out of the den into the garden a little later she thought
Alberto would have been well pleased with her diversionary maneuvers.
The major could not have thought much about Alberto during the past
hour. If he did, he had to have a severe case of split personality.</P>
<p>
Sophie had just walked in the front
door when her mother came home from work. That saved her having to
describe her rescue from a tall tree by a tame goose.</P>
<p>
After dinner they began to get
everything ready for the garden party. They brought a four-meter-long
table top and trestles from the attic and carried it into the garden.</P>
<p>
They had planned to set out the long
table under the fruit trees. The last time they had used the trestle
table had been on Sophie&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; tenth anniversary.
Sophie was only eight years old at the time, but she clearly
remembered the big outdoor party with all their friends and
relatives.</P>
<p>
The weather report was as good as it
could be. There had not been as much as a drop of rain since that
horrid thunderstorm the day before Sophie&rsquo;s birthday.
Nevertheless they decided to leave the actual table setting and
decorating until Saturday morning.</P>
<p>
Later that evening they baked two
different kinds of bread. They were going to serve chicken and salad.
And sodas. Sophie was worried that some of the boys in her class
would bring beer. If there was one thing she was afraid of it was
trouble.</P>
<p>
As Sophie was going to bed, her mother
asked her once again if Alberto was coming to the party.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;s coming. He
has even promised to do a philosophical trick.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A philosophical trick? What
kind of trick is that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No idea ... if he were a
magician, he would have done a magic trick. He would probably have
pulled a white rabbit out of a hat. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What, again?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But since he&rsquo;s a
philosopher, he&rsquo;s going to do a philosophical trick
instead. After all, it is a philosophical garden party. Are you
planning to do something too?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Actually, I am.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A speech?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling. Good
night, Sophie!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Early the next morning Sophie was
woken up by her mother, who came in to say goodbye before she went to
work. She gave Sophie a list of last-minute things to buy in town for
the garden party.</P>
<p>
The minute her mother had left the
house, the telephone rang. It was Alberto. He had obviously found out
exactly when Sophie was home alone.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How is your secret coming
along?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ssh! Not a word. Don&rsquo;t
even give him the chance to think about it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I held his attention
yesterday &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is the philosophy course
finished?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
calling. We&rsquo;re already in our own century. From now on you
should be able to orient yourself on your own. The foundations were
the most important. But we must nevertheless meet for a short talk
about our own time &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I have to go to town . .  &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s excellent. I said
it was our own time we had to talk about.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So it would be most practical
to meet in town, I mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall I come to your place?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no, not here Everything&rsquo;s
a mess. I&rsquo;ve been hunting for hidden microphones.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cafe that&rsquo;s
just opened at the Main Square. Cafe Pierre. Do you know it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. When shall I be there?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can we meet at twelve?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay. Bye!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
At a couple of minutes past twelve
Sophie walked into Cafe Pierre. It was one of those new fashionable
places with little round tables and black chairs, upturned vermouth
bottles in dispensers, baguettes, and sandwiches.</P>
<p>
The room was small, and the first
thing Sophie noticed was that Alberto was not there. A lot of other
people were sitting at the round tables, but Sophie saw only that
Alberto was not among them.</P>
<p>
She was not in the habit of going into
cafes on her own. Should she just turn around and leave, and come
back later to see if he had arrived?</P>
<p>
She ordered a cup of lemon tea at the
marble bar and sat down at one of the vacant tables. She stared at
the door. People came and went all the time, but there was still no
Alberto.</P>
<p>
If only she had a newspaper!</P>
<p>
As time passed, she started to look
around. She got a couple of glances in return. For a moment Sophie
felt like a young woman. She was only fifteen, but she could
certainly have passed for seventeen&mdash;or at least, sixteen
and a half.</P>
<p>
She wondered what all these people
thought about being alive. They looked as though they had simply
dropped in, as though they had just sat down here by chance. They
were all talking away, gesticulating vehemently, but it didn&rsquo;t
look as though they were talking about anything that mattered.</P>
<p>
She suddenly came to think of
Kierkegaard, who had said that what characterized the crowd most was
their idle chatter. Were all these people living at the aesthetic
stage? Or was there something that was existentially important
to them?</P>
<p>
In one of his early letters to her
Alberto had talked about the similarity between children and
philosophers. She realized again that she was afraid of becoming an
adult. Suppose she too ended up crawling deep down into the fur of
the white rabbit that was pulled out of the universe&rsquo;s top hat!</P>
<p>
She kept her eyes on the door.
Suddenly Alberto walked in. Although it was midsummer, he was wearing
a black beret and a gray hip-length coat of herringbone tweed. He
hurried over to her. It felt very strange to meet him in public.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quarter past
twelve!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what is known as the
academic quarter of an hour. Would you like a snack?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He sat down and looked into her eyes.
Sophie shrugged.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure. A sandwich, maybe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto went up to the counter. He
soon returned with a cup of coffee and two baguette sandwiches with
cheese and ham.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was it expensive?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;A bagatelle, Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you have any excuse at all
for being late?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No. I did it on purpose. I&rsquo;ll
explain why presently.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He took a few large bites of his
sandwich. Then he said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about our own
century.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Has anything of philosophical
interest happened?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Lots ... movements are going
off in all directions We&rsquo;ll start with one very important
direction, and that is existentialism. This is a collective term for
several philosophical currents that take man&rsquo;s existential
situation as their point of departure. We generally talk of
twentieth-century existential philosophy. Several of these
existential philosophers, or existentialists, based their ideas not
only on Kierkegaard, but on Hegel and Marx as well.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Another important philosopher
who had a great influence on the twentieth century was the
German Friedrich Nietzsche, who lived from 1844 to 1900. He, too,
reacted against Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy and the German
&lsquo;historicism.&rsquo; He proposed life itself as a counterweight
to the anemic interest in history and what he called the Christian
&lsquo;slave morality.&rsquo; He sought to effect a &lsquo;revaluation
of all values,&rsquo; so that the life force of the strongest should
not be hampered by the weak. According to Nietzsche, both
Christianity and traditional philosophy had turned away from the real
world and pointed toward &lsquo;heaven&rsquo; or &lsquo;the world of
ideas.&rsquo; But what had hitherto been considered the &lsquo;real&rsquo;
world was in fact a pseudo world. &lsquo;Be true to the world,&rsquo;
he said. &lsquo;Do not listen to those who offer you supernatural
expectations.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So ... ?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A man who was influenced by
both Kierkegaard and Nietzsche was the German existential philosopher
Martin Heidegger. But we are going to concentrate on the French
existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre, who lived from 1905 to 1980. He was
the leading light among the existentialists&mdash;at least, to
the broader public. His existentialism became especially popular
in the forties, just after the war. Later on he allied himself with
the Marxist movement in France, but he never became a member of any
party.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that why we are meeting in a
French cafe?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;It was not quite accidental, I
confess. Sartre himself spent a lot of time in cafes. He met his
life-long companion Simone de Beauvoir in a cafe. She was also an
existential philosopher.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A woman philosopher?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a relief that humanity is
finally becoming civilized.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nevertheless, many new problems
have arisen in our own time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You were going to talk about
existentialism.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sartre said that
&lsquo;existentialism is humanism.&rsquo; By that he meant that the
existentialists start from nothing but humanity itself. I might
add that the humanism he was referring to took a far bleaker
view of the human situation than the humanism we met in the
Renaissance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why was that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Both Kierkegaard and some of
this century&rsquo;s existential philosophers were Christian. But
Sartre&rsquo;s allegiance was to what we might call an atheistic
existentialism. His philosophy can be seen as a merciless
analysis of the human situation when &lsquo;God is dead.&rsquo; The
expression &lsquo;God is dead&rsquo; came from Nietzsche.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The key word in Sartre&rsquo;s
philosophy, as in Kierkegaard&rsquo;s, is &lsquo;existence.&rsquo;
But existence did not mean the same as being alive. Plants and
animals are also alive, they exist, but they do not have to think
about what it implies. Man is the only living creature that is
conscious of its own existence. Sartre said that a material thing is
simply &lsquo;in itself,&rsquo; but mankind is &lsquo;for itself.&rsquo;
The being of man is therefore not the same as the being of things.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t disagree with
that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sartre said that man&rsquo;s
existence takes priority over whatever he might otherwise be. The
fact that I exist takes priority over what I am. &lsquo;Existence
takes priority over essence.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was a very complicated
statement.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;By essence we mean that which
something consists of&mdash;the nature, or being, of something. But
according to Sartre, man has no such innate &lsquo;nature.&rsquo; Man
must therefore create himself. He must create his own nature or
&lsquo;essence,&rsquo; because it is not fixed in advance.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I see what you mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Throughout the entire history
of philosophy, philosophers have sought to discover what man
is&mdash;or what human nature is. But Sartre believed that man
has no such eternal &lsquo;nature&rsquo; to fall back on. It is
therefore useless to search for the meaning of life in general. We
are condemned to improvise. We are like actors dragged onto the
stage without having learned our lines, with no script and no
prompter to whisper stage directions to us. We must decide for
ourselves how to live.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, actually. If
one could just look in the Bible&mdash;or in a philosophy
book&mdash;to find out how to live, it would be very practical.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the point.
When people realize they are alive and will one day die&mdash;and
there is no meaning to cling to&mdash;they experience angst, said
Sartre. You may recall that angst, a sense of dread, was also
characteristic of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s description of a person in an
existential situation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sartre says that man feels
a//en in a world without meaning. When he describes man&rsquo;s
&lsquo;alienation,&rsquo; he is echoing the central ideas of Hegel
and Marx. Man&rsquo;s feeling of alienation in the world creates
a sense of despair, boredom, nausea, and absurdity.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is quite normal to feel
depressed, or to feel that everything is just too boring.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Sartre was
describing the twentieth-century city dweller. You remember that the
Renaissance humanists had drawn attention, almost triumphantly, to
man&rsquo;s freedom and independence? Sartre experienced man&rsquo;s
freedom as a curse. &lsquo;Man is condemned to be free,&rsquo; he
said. &lsquo;Condemned because he has not created himself&mdash;and
is nevertheless free. Because having once been hurled into the world,
he is responsible for everything he does.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t asked to
be created as free individuals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was precisely Sartre&rsquo;s
point. Nevertheless we are free individuals, and this freedom
condemns us to make choices throughout our lives. There are no
eternal values or norms we can adhere to, which makes our choices
even more significant. Because we are totally responsible for
everything we do. Sartre emphasized that man must never disclaim the
responsibility for his actions. Nor can we avoid the responsibility
of making our own choices on the grounds that we &lsquo;must&rsquo;
go to work, or we &lsquo;must&rsquo; live up to certain middle-class
expectations regarding how we should live. Those who thus slip into
the anonymous masses will never be other than members of the
impersonal flock, having fled from themselves into
self-deception. On the other hand our freedom obliges us to make
something of ourselves, to live &lsquo;authentically&rsquo; or
&lsquo;truly.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is not least the case as
regards our ethical choices. We can never lay the blame on &lsquo;human
nature,&rsquo; or &lsquo;human frailty&rsquo; or anything like that.
Now and then it happens that grown men behave like pigs and then
blame it on &lsquo;the old Adam.&rsquo; But there is no &lsquo;old
Adam.&rsquo; He is merely a figure we clutch at to avoid taking
responsibility for our own actions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There ought to be a limit to
what man can be blamed for.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Although Sartre claimed there
was no innate meaning to life, he did not mean that nothing mattered.
He was not what we call a nihilist.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is a person who thinks
nothing means anything and everything is permissible. Sartre believed
that life must have meaning. It is an imperative. But it is we
ourselves who must create this meaning in our own lives. To
exist is to create your own life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Could you elaborate on that?&rdquo;
/</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sartre tried to prove that
consciousness in itself is nothing until it has perceived
something. Because consciousness is always conscious of
something. And this &lsquo;something&rsquo; is provided just as much
by ourselves as by our surroundings. We are partly instrumental in
deciding what we perceive by selecting what is significant for us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Could you give me an example?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Two people can be present in
the same room and yet experience it quite differently. This is
because we contribute our own meaning&mdash;or our own
interests&mdash;when we perceive our surroundings. A woman who is
pregnant might think she sees other pregnant women everywhere she
looks. That is not because there were no pregnant women before, but
because now that she is pregnant she sees the world through different
eyes. An escaped convict may see policemen everywhere ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Mm, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Our own lives influence the way
we perceive things in the room. If something is of no interest to me,
I don&rsquo;t see it. So now I can perhaps explain why I was late
today.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was on purpose, right?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me first of all what you
saw when you came in here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The first thing I saw was that
you weren&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange that the
first thing you noticed was something that was absent?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe, but it was you I was
supposed to meet.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sartre uses just such a cafe
visit to demonstrate the way we &lsquo;annihilate&rsquo; whatever is
irrelevant for us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You got here late just to
demonstrate that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To enable you to understand
this central point in Sartre&rsquo;s philosophy, yes. Call it an
exercise.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you were in love, and were
waiting for your loved one to call you, you might &lsquo;hear&rsquo;
him not calling you all evening. You arrange to meet him at the
train; crowds of people are milling about on the platform and you
can&rsquo;t see him anywhere. They are all in the way, they are
unimportant to you. You might find them aggravating, unpleasant
even. They are taking up far too much room. The only thing you
register is that he is not there.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How sad.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Simone de Beauvoir attempted to
apply existentialism to feminism. Sartre had already said that man
has no basic &lsquo;nature&rsquo; to fall back on. We create
ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;This is also true of the way
we perceive the sexes. Simone de Beauvoir denied the existence of a
basic &lsquo;female nature&rsquo; or &lsquo;male nature.&rsquo;
For instance, it has been generally claimed that man has a
&lsquo;transcending,&rsquo; or achieving, nature. He will therefore
seek meaning and direction outside the home. Woman has been said to
have the opposite life philosophy. She is &lsquo;immanent,&rsquo;
which means she wishes to be where she is. She will therefore nurture
her family, care for the environment and more homely things. Nowadays
we might say that women are more concerned with &lsquo;feminine
values&rsquo; than men.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did she really believe that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t listening to
me. Simone de Beauvoir in fact did not believe in the existence of
any such &lsquo;female nature&rsquo; or &lsquo;male nature.&rsquo; On
the contrary, she believed that women and men must liberate
themselves from such ingrown prejudices or ideals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Her main work, published in
1949, was called The Second Sex.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What did she mean by that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She was talking about women. In
our culture women are treated as the second sex. Men behave as if
they are the subjects, treating women like their objects, thus
depriving them of the responsibility for their own life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She meant we women are exactly
as free and independent as we choose to be?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you could put it like
that. Existentialism also had a great influence on literature, from
the forties to the present day, especially on drama. Sartre
himself wrote plays as well as novels. Other important writers were
the Frenchman Albert Camus, the Irishman Samuel Beckett, Eugene
lonesco, who was from Romania, and Witold Gombro-wicz from Poland.
Their characteristic style, and that of many other modern writers,
was what we call absurdism. The term is especially used about the
&lsquo;theater of the absurd.&rsquo; &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you know what we mean by the
&lsquo;absurd&rsquo;?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it something that
is meaningless or irrational?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Precisely. The theater of the
absurd represented a contrast to realistic theater. Its aim was to
show the lack of meaning in life in order to get the audience to
disagree. The idea was not to cultivate the meaningless. On the
contrary. But by showing and exposing the absurd in ordinary
everyday situations, the onlookers are forced to seek a truer and
more essential life for themselves.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It sounds interesting.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The theater of the absurd often
portrays situations that are absolutely trivial. It can therefore
also be called a kind of &lsquo;hyperrealism.&rsquo; People are
portrayed precisely as they are. But if you reproduce on stage
exactly what goes on in the bathroom on a perfectly ordinary morning
in a perfectly ordinary home, the audience would laugh. Their
laughter could be interpreted as a defense mechanism against seeing
themselves lampooned on stage.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, exactly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The absurd theater can also
have certain surrealistic features. Its characters often find
themselves in highly unrealistic and dreamlike situations. When
they accept this without surprise, the audience is compelled to react
in surprise at the characters&rsquo; lack of surprise. This was
how Charlie Chaplin worked in his silent movies. The comic effect in
these silent movies was often Chaplin&rsquo;s laconic acceptance of
all the absurd things that happen to him. That compelled the audience
to look into themselves for something more genuine and true.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly surprising
to see what people put up with without protesting.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;At times it can be right to
feel: This is something I must get away from&mdash;even though I
don&rsquo;t have any idea where to go.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If the house catches fire you
just have to get out, even if you don&rsquo;t have any other place to
live.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Would you
like another cup of tea? Or a Coke maybe?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Okay. But I still think you
were silly to be late.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can live with that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto came back with a cup of
espresso and a Coke. Meanwhile Sophie had begun to like the cafe
ambience. She was also beginning to think that the conversations at
the other tables might not be as trivial as she had supposed
them to be.</P>
<p>
Alberto banged the Coke bottle down on
the table with a thud. Several people at the other tables looked up.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that brings us to the end
of the road,&rdquo; he said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You mean the history of
philosophy stops with Sartre and existentialism?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, that would be an
exaggeration. Existentialist philosophy has had radical
significance for many people all over the world. As we saw, its roots
reach far back in history through Kierkegaard and way back to
Socrates. The twentieth century has also witnessed a blossoming and a
renewal of the other philosophical currents we have discussed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, one such current is
Neo-Thomism, that is to say ideas which belong to the tradition of
Thomas Aquinas. Another is the so-called analytical philosophy or
logical empiricism, with roots reaching back to Hume and British
empiricism, and even to the logic of Aristotle. Apart from these, the
twentieth century has naturally also been influenced by what we
might call Neo-Marxism in a myriad of various trends. We have already
talked about Neo-Darwinism and the significance of psychoanalysis.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We should just mention a final
current, materialism, which also has historical roots. A lot of
current science can be traced back to the efforts of the
pre-Socratics. For example, the search for the indivisible &lsquo;elemental
particle&rsquo; of which all matter is composed. No one has yet been
able to give a satisfactory explanation of what &lsquo;matter&rsquo;
is. Modern sciences such as nuclear physics and biochemistry are
so fascinated by the problem that for many people it constitutes
a vital part of their life&rsquo;s philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The new and the old all jumbled
together . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Because the very questions
we started our course with are still unanswered. Sartre made an
important observation when he said that existential questions
cannot be answered once and for all. A philosophical question is by
definition something that each generation, each individual even,
must ask over and over again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;A bleak thought.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I agree.
Surely it is by asking such questions that we know we are alive.
And moreover, it has always been the case that while people were
seeking answers to the ultimate questions, they have discovered
clear and final solutions to many other problems. Science, research,
and technology are all by-products of our philosophical
reflection. Was it not our wonder about life that finally brought men
to the moon?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When Neil Armstrong set foot on
the moon, he said &lsquo;One small step for man, one giant leap for
mankind.&rsquo; With these words he summed up how it felt to be the
first man to set foot on the moon, drawing with him all the people
who had lived before him. It was not his merit alone, obviously.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In our own time we also have
completely new problems to face. The most serious are those of
the environment. A central philosophical direction in the
twentieth century is therefore ecophilosophy or ecosophy, as one of
its founders the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess has called if. Many
ecophilosophers in the western world have warned that western
civilization as a whole is on a fundamentally wrong track,
racing toward a head-on collision with the limits of what our
planet can tolerate. They have tried to take soundings that go deeper
than the concrete effects of pollution and environmental
destruction. There is something basically wrong with western thought,
they claim.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think they are right.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For example, ecophilosophy has
questioned the very idea of evolution in its assumption that man is
&lsquo;at the top&rsquo;&mdash;as if we are masters of nature. This
way of thinking could prove to be fatal for the whole living planet.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It makes me mad when I think
about it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In criticizing this assumption,
many ecophilosophers have looked to the thinking and ideas in other
cultures such as those of India. They have also studied the thoughts
and customs of so-called primitive peoples&mdash;or &lsquo;native-peoples&rsquo;
such as the Native Americans&mdash;in order to rediscover what
we have lost.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;In scientific circles in
recent years it has been said that our whole mode of scientific
thought is facing a &lsquo;paradigm shift.&rsquo; That is to say, a
fundamental shift in the way scientists think. This has already
borne fruit in several fields. We have witnessed numerous examples of
so-called &lsquo;alternative movements&rsquo; advocating holism
and a new lifestyle.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Great.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;However, when there are many
people involved, one must always distinguish between good and bad.
Some proclaim that we are entering a new age. But everything new is
not necessarily good, and not all the old should be thrown out. That
is one of the reasons why I have given you this course in philosophy.
Now you have the historical background, you can orient yourself in
life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think you will find that much
of what marches under the New Age banner is humbug. Even the
so-called New Religion, New Occultism, and modern superstitions of
all kinds have influenced the western world in recent decades.
It has become an industry. Alternative offers on the philosophical
market have mushroomed in the wake of the dwindling support for
Christianity.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What sort of offers?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The list is so long I wouldn&rsquo;t
dare to begin. And anyway it&rsquo;s not easy to describe one&rsquo;s
own age. But why don&rsquo;t we take a stroll through town? There&rsquo;s
something I&rsquo;d like you to see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got much time.
I hope you haven&rsquo;t forgotten the garden party tomorrow?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course not. That&rsquo;s
when something wonderful is going to happen. We just have to
round off Hilde&rsquo;s philosophy course first. The major
hasn&rsquo;t thought beyond that, you see. So he loses some of his
mastery over us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Once again he lifted the Coke bottle,
which was now empty, and banged it down on the table.</P>
<p>
They walked out into the street where
people were hurrying by like energetic moles in a molehill.
Sophie wondered what Alberto wanted to show her.</P>
<p>
They walked past a big store that sold
everything in communication technology, from televisions, VCRs, and
satellite dishes to mobile phones, computers, and fax machines.</P>
<p>
Alberto pointed to the window display
and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There you have the twentieth
century, Sophie. In the Renaissance the world began to explode, so to
speak. Beginning with the great voyages of discovery, Europeans
started to travel all over the world. Today it&rsquo;s the opposite.
We could call it an explosion in reverse.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In what sense?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In the sense that the world is
becoming drawn together into one great communications network. Not so
long ago philosophers had to travel for days by horse and carriage in
order to investigate the world around them and meet other
philosophers. Today we can sit anywhere at all on this planet and
access the whole of human experience on a computer screen.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fantastic thought.
And a little scary.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The question is whether history
is coming to an end&mdash; or whether on the contrary we are on the
threshold of a completely new age. We are no longer simply citizens
of a city&mdash;or of a particular country. We live in a planetary
civilization.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Technological developments,
especially in the field of communications, have possibly been more
dramatic in the last thirty to forty years than in the whole of
history put together. And still we have probably only witnessed the
beginning . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was this what you wanted me to
see?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s on the other
side of the church over there.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
As they were turning to leave, a
picture of some UN soldiers flashed onto a TV screen.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
The camera zoomed in on one of the UN
soldiers. He had a black beard almost identical to Alberto&rsquo;s.
Suddenly he held up a piece of card on which was written: &ldquo;Back
soon, Hilde!&rdquo; He waved and was gone.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Charlatan!&rdquo; exclaimed
Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Was that the major?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even going to
answer that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They walked across the park in front
of the church and came out onto another main street. Alberto seemed
slightly irritable. They stopped in front of LIBRIS, the biggest
bookstore in town.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in,&rdquo; said
Alberto.</P>
<p>
Inside the -store he pointed to the
longest wall. It had three sections: NEW AGE, ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLES,
and MYSTICISM.</P>
<p>
The books had intriguing titles such
as Life after Death?, The Secrets of Spiritism, Tarot, The UFO
Phenomenon, Healing, The Return of the Gods, You Have Been Here
Before, and What Is Astrology? There were hundreds of books. Under
the shelves even more books were stacked up.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is also the twentieth
century, Sophie. This is the temple of our age.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in any
of this stuff?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Much of it is humbug. But it
sells as well as pornography. A lot of it is a kind of
pornography. Young people can come here and purchase the ideas that
fascinate them most. But the difference between real philosophy and
these books is more or less the same as the difference between real
love and pornography.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you being rather
crass?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and sit in the
park.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They marched out of the store and
found a vacant bench in front of the church. Pigeons were strutting
around under the trees, the odd overeager sparrow hopping about
amongst them.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called ESP or
parapsychology,&rdquo; said Alberto. &ldquo;Or it&rsquo;s called
telepathy, clairvoyance, and psychokinetics. It&rsquo;s called
spiritism, astrology, and urology.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But quite honestly, do you
really think it&rsquo;s all hum-bug?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Obviously it would not be very
appropriate for a real philosopher to say they are all equally bad.
But I don&rsquo;t mind saying that all these subjects together
possibly chart a fairly detailed map of a landscape that does not
exist. And there are many &lsquo;figments of the imagination&rsquo;
here that Hume would have committed to the flames. Many of those
books do not contain so much as one iota of genuine experience.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Why are there such incredible
numbers of books on such subjects?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Publishing such books is a big
commercial enterprise. It&rsquo;s what most people want.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, do you think?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They obviously desire something
mystical, something different to break the dreary monotony of
everyday life. But it is like carrying coals to Newcastle.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Here we are, wandering around
in a wonderful adventure. A work of creation is emerging in
front of our very eyes. In broad daylight, Sophie! Isn&rsquo;t it
marvelous!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why should we enter the
fortune-teller&rsquo;s tent or the backyards of academe in search of
something exciting or transcendental?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you saying that the people
who write these books are just phonies and liars?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m
saying. But here, too, we are talking about a Darwinian system.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to explain
that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Think of all the different
things that can happen in a single day. You can even take a day in
your own life. Think of all the things you see and experience.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now and then you experience a
strange coincidence. You might go into a store and buy something for
28 crowns. Later on that day Joanna comes along and gives you the 28
crowns she owes you. You both decide to go to the movies&mdash;and
you get seat number 28.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that would be a mysterious
coincidence.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It would be a coincidence,
anyway. The point is, people collect coincidences like these.
They collect strange&mdash; or inexplicable&mdash;experiences When
such experiences&mdash; taken from the lives of billions of
people&mdash;are assembled into books, it begins to look like genuine
data. And the amount of it increases all the time. But once again we
are looking at a lottery in which only the winning numbers are
visible.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But there are clairvoyants and
mediums, aren&rsquo;t there, who are constantly experiencing things
like that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Indeed there are, and if we
exclude the phonies, we find another explanation for these so-called
mysterious experiences.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You remember we talked about
Freud&rsquo;s theory of the unconscious . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Freud showed that we can often
serve as &lsquo;mediums&rsquo; for our own unconscious. We might
suddenly find ourselves thinking or doing something without
really knowing why. The reason is that we have a whole lot of
experiences, thoughts, and memories inside us that we are not
aware of.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;People sometimes talk or walk
in their sleep. We could call this a sort of &lsquo;mental
automatism.&rsquo; Also under hypnosis, people can say and do
things &lsquo;not of their own volition.&rsquo; And remember the
surrealists trying to produce so-called automatic writing. They were
just trying to serve as mediums for their own unconscious.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;From time to time during this
century there have been what are called &lsquo;spiritualist
revivals,&rsquo; the idea being that a medium could get into contact
with a deceased person. Either by speaking in the voice of the
deceased, or by using automatic writing, the medium would receive a
message from someone who had lived five or fifty or many
hundreds of years ago. This has been taken as evidence either that
there is life after death or that we live many lives.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that all
mediums have been fakes. Some have clearly been in good faith. They
really have been mediums, but they have only been mediums for their
own unconscious. There have been several cases of mediums being
closely studied while in a trance, and revealing knowledge and
abilities that neither they nor others understand how they can have
acquired. In one case, a woman who had no knowledge of Hebrew passed
on messages in that language. So she must have either lived before or
been in contact with a deceased spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Which do you think?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It turned out that she had had
a Jewish nanny when she was little.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does that disappoint you? It
just shows what an incredible capacity some people have to store
experience in their unconscious.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I see what you mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A lot of curious everyday
happenings can be explained by Freud&rsquo;s theory of the
unconscious. I might suddenly get a call from a friend I haven&rsquo;t
heard from for many years just as I had begun to look for his
telephone number &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It gives me goose bumps.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But the explanation could be
that we both heard the same old song on the radio, a song we heard
the last time we were together. The point is, we are not aware of the
underlying connection.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s either humbug, or
the winning number effect, or else it&rsquo;s the unconscious.
Right?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, in any case, it&rsquo;s
healthier to approach such books with a decent portion of skepticism.
Not least if one is a philosopher. There is an association in England
for skeptics. Many years ago they offered a large reward to the first
person who could provide even the slightest proof of something
supernatural. It didn&rsquo;t need to be a great miracle, a tiny
example of telepathy would do. So far, nobody has come forward &ldquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;On the other hand, there is a
lot we humans don&rsquo;t understand. Maybe we don&rsquo;t understand
the laws of nature either. During the last century there were a
lot of people who thought that phenomena such as magnetism and
electricity were a kind of magic. I&rsquo;ll bet my own
great-grandmother would have been wide-eyed with amazement if I
told her about TV or computers.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t believe in
anything supernatural then.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already talked
about that. Even the term &lsquo;supernatural&rsquo; is a
curious one. No, I suppose I believe that there is only one nature.
But that, on the other hand, is absolutely astonishing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But the sort of mysterious
things in those books you just showed me?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All true philosophers should
keep their eyes open. Even if we have never seen a white crow, we
should never stop looking for it. And one day, even a skeptic like me
could be obliged to accept a phenomenon I did not believe in
before. If I did not keep this possibility open I would be dogmatic,
and not a true philosopher.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto and Sophie remained seated on
the bench without saying anything. The pigeons craned their
necks and cooed, now and then being startled by a bicycle or a sudden
movement.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have to go home and prepare
for the party,&rdquo; said Sophie at last.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But before we part, I&rsquo;ll
show you a white crow. It is nearer than we think, you see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto got up and led the way back
into the bookstore. This time they walked past all the books on
supernatural phenomena and stopped by a flimsy shelf at the very back
of the store. Above the shelf hung a very small card. PHILOSOPHY,
it read.</P>
<p>
Alberto pointed down at a particular
book, and Sophie gasped as she read the title: Sophie&rsquo;s World.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you like me to buy it for
you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I dare.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Shortly afterward, however, she was on
her way home with the book in one hand and a little bag of things for
the garden party in the other.</P>
<br /><h3>The Garden Party</h3><br />
<p>
... a white crow&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Hilde sat on the bed, transfixed. She felt her arms and her hands
tremble, as they gripped the heavy ring binder.</P>
<p>
It was almost eleven o&rsquo;clock. She had been reading for over two
hours. From time to time she had raised her eyes from the text and
laughed aloud, but she had also turned over on her side and gasped.
It was a good thing she was alone in the house.</P>
<p>
And what she had been through these last two hours! It started with
Sophie trying to attract the major&rsquo;s attention on the way
home from the cabin in the woods. She had finally climbed a tree and
been rescued by Morten Goose, who had arrived like a guardian angel
from Lebanon.</P>
<p>
Although it was a long, long time ago, Hilde had never forgotten how
her father had read The Wonderful Adventures of Nils to her. For many
years after that, she and her father had had a secret language
together that was connected with the book. Now he had dragged the old
goose out again.</P>
<p>
Then Sophie had her first experience as a lone customer in a
cafe. Hilde had been especially taken with what Alberto said about
Sartre and existentialism. He had almost managed to convert
her&mdash;although he had done that many times before in the ring
binder too.</P>
<p>
Once, about a year ago, Hilde had bought a book on astrology. Another
time she had come home with a set of tarot cards. Next time it was a
book on spiritualism. Each time, her father had lectured her about
&ldquo;superstition&rdquo; and her &ldquo;critical faculty,&rdquo;
but he had waited until now for the final blow. His counterattack was
deadly accurate. Clearly, his daughter would not be allowed to grow
up without a thorough warning against that kind of thing. To be
absolutely sure, he had waved to her from a TV screen in a radio
store. He could have saved himself the trouble ...</P>
<p>
What she wondered about most of all was Sophie. Sophie&mdash;who are
you? Where do you come from? Why have you come into my life?</P>
<p>
Finally Sophie had been given a book about herself. Was it the same
book that Hilde now had in her hands? This was only a ring binder.
But even so&mdash;how could one find a book about oneself in a book
about oneself? What would happen if Sophie began to read that book?</P>
<p>
What was going to happen now? What could happen now? There were only
a few pages left in her ring binder.</P>
<p>
Sophie met her mother on the bus on
her way home from town. Oh, no! What would her mother say when she
saw the book in Sophie&rsquo;s hand?</P>
<p>
Sophie tried to put it in the bag with
all the streamers and balloons she had bought for the party but she
didn&rsquo;t quite make it.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hi, Sophie! We caught the same
bus! How nice!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hi, Mom!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You bought a book?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not exactly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sophie&rsquo;s World ... how
curious.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie knew she didn&rsquo;t have the
slightest chance of lying to her mother.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I got it from Alberto.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure you did. As
I said, I&rsquo;m looking forward to meeting this man. May I see?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you mind very much
waiting till we get home, at least. It is my book, Mom.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s your book.
I just want to take a peek at the first page, okay? ... &lsquo;Sophie
Amundsen was on her way home from school. She had walked the first
part of the way with Joanna. They had been discussing robots . . .&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does it really say that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it does, Sophie. It&rsquo;s
written by someone called Albert Knag. He must be a newcomer. What&rsquo;s
your Al-berto&rsquo;s name, by the way?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Knox.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll probably turn out
that this extraordinary person has written a whole book about you,
Sophie. It&rsquo;s called using a pseudonym.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not him, Mom. Why
don&rsquo;t you just give up. You don&rsquo;t understand anything
anyway.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose I do.
The garden party is tomorrow, then everything will be all right
again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Albert Knag lives in a
completely different reality. That&rsquo;s why this book is a white
crow.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You really must stop all this!
Wasn&rsquo;t it a white rabbit?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You stop it!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
That was as far as they got before
they reached their stop at the end of Clover Close. They ran straight
into a demonstration.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; exclaimed Helene
Amundsen, &ldquo;I really thought we would be spared street politics
in this neighborhood.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
There were no more than about ten or
twelve people. Their banners read:</P>
<p>
THE MAJOR IS AT HAND</P>
<p>
YES TO YUMMY MIDSUMMER EATS</P>
<p>
MORE POWER TO THE UN</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie almost felt sorry for her
mother.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But it was a peculiar
demonstration, Sophie. Quite absurd, really.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was a mere bagatelle.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The world changes more and more
rapidly all the time. Actually, I&rsquo;m not in the least
surprised.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You should be surprised that
you&rsquo;re not surprised, at any rate.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Not at all. They weren&rsquo;t
violent, were they? I just hope they haven&rsquo;t trampled all over
our rosebeds. Surely it can&rsquo;t be necessary to demonstrate in a
garden. Let&rsquo;s hurry home and see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was a philosophical
demonstration, Mom. Real philosophers don&rsquo;t trample on
rosebeds.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,
Sophie. I don&rsquo;t think I believe in real philosophers any
longer. Everything is synthetic nowadays.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They spent the afternoon and evening
preparing. They continued the next morning, setting and decorating
the table. Joanna came over to give them a hand.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Good grief!&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;Mom and Dad are coming too. It&rsquo;s your fault, Sophie!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Everything was ready half an hour
before the guests were due. The trees were festooned with streamers
and Japanese lanterns. The garden gate, the trees lining the path,
and the front of the house were hung with balloons. Sophie and Joanna
had spent most of the afternoon blowing them up.</P>
<p>
The table was set with chicken, salad,
and different kinds of homemade bread. In the kitchen there were
raisin buns and layer cake, Danish pastry and chocolate cake. But
from the start the place of honor in the center of the table was
reserved for the birthday cake&mdash;a pyramid of almond-paste rings.
On the top of the cake was the tiny figure of a girl in a
confirmation dress. Sophie&rsquo;s mother had assured her that it
could just as well represent an unconfirmed fifteen-year-old, but
Sophie was certain her mother had only put it there because Sophie
had told her she was not sure she wanted to be confirmed. Her mother
seemed to think the cake embodied the confirmation itself.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t spared any
expense,&rdquo; she repeated several times in the half hour
before the party was due to start.</P>
<p>
The guests began to arrive. First came
three of the girls from Sophie&rsquo;s class, dressed in summer
shirts and light cardigans, long skirts, and the barest suggestion of
eye makeup. A bit later, Jeremy and David came strolling in through
the gate, with a blend of shyness and boyish arrogance.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Happy birthday!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an adult now,
too!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie noticed that Joanna and Jeremy
had already begun eyeing each other discreetly. There was something
in the air. It was Midsummer Eve.</P>
<p>
Everybody had brought birthday
presents, and as it was a philosophical garden party, several of the
guests had tried to find out what philosophy was. Although not all of
them had managed to find philosophical presents, most of them had
written something philosophical on their cards. Sophie received a
philosophical dictionary as well as a diary with a lock; on the cover
was written MY PERSONAL PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHTS. As the guests
arrived they were served apple juice in long-stemmed wine glasses.
Sophie&rsquo;s mother did the serving.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Welcome ... And what is this
young man&rsquo;s name? I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve met before
... So glad you could come, Cecilie . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
When all the younger guests had
arrived and were strolling under the trees with their wine glasses,
Joanna&rsquo;s parents drew up at the garden gate in a white
Mercedes. The financial adviser was impeccably dressed in an
expensively cut gray suit. His wife was wearing a red pants suit
with dark red sequins. Sophie was sure she had bought a Barbie doll
in a toy store dressed in that suit, and had a tailor make it up in
her size. There was another possibility; the financial adviser could
have bought the doll and given it to a magician to make into a live
woman. But this possibility was unlikely, so Sophie rejected it.</P>
<p>
They stepped out of the Mercedes and
walked into the garden where younger guests looked at them with
surprise. The financial adviser presented a long, narrow package
from the Ingebrigtsen family. Sophie tried hard to maintain her
composure when it turned out to be&mdash;yes, it was!&mdash;a Barbie
doll. But Joanna made no such effort:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you crazy? Sophie doesn&rsquo;t
play with dolls!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Mrs. Ingebrigtsen came hurrying over,
with all her sequins clanking. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only for
decoration, you know.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, thank you very much
indeed.&rdquo; Sophie tried to smooth things over. &ldquo;Now I can
start ft collection.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
People began to drift toward the
table.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only waiting for
Alberto,&rdquo; said Sophie&rsquo;s mother to her in a somewhat brisk
tone that was intended to hide her growing apprehension. Rumors of
the special guest of honor had already spread among the other guests.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He has promised to come, so
he&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t seat the
guests before he arrives, can we?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course we can. Let&rsquo;s
go ahead.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Helene Amundsen began to seat people
around the long table. She made sure that the vacant chair was
between her own and Sophie&rsquo;s place. She said a few words
about the beautiful weather and the fact that Sophie was now a
grownup.</P>
<p>
They had been sitting at the table for
half an hour when a middle-aged man with a black goatee and a beret
came walking up Clover Close and in through the garden gate. He was
carrying a bouquet of fifteen red roses.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Alberto!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie left the table and ran to greet
him. She threw her arms around his neck and took the bouquet from
him. He responded to the welcome by rooting around in his jacket
pocket and drawing out a couple of Chinese firecrackers which he
lit and tossed into the yard. As. he approached the table, he
lit a sparkler and set it on top of the almond pyramid. Then he went
over and stood at the empty place between Sophie and her mother.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to be
here,&rdquo; he said.</P>
<p>
The guests were dumbstruck. Mrs.
Ingebrigtsen gave her husband a significant look. Sophie&rsquo;s
mother was so relieved that the man had finally arrived, however,
that she would have forgiven him anything. Sophie herself was
struggling to suppress her laughter.</P>
<p>
Helene Amundsen tapped on her glass
and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us also welcome Alberto
Knox to this philosophical garden party. He is not my new boyfriend,
because although my husband is so often away at sea, I don&rsquo;t
have a new boyfriend for the time being. However, this astounding
person is Sophie&rsquo;s new philosophy teacher. His prowess extends
further than to setting off fireworks.</P>
<p>
This man is able, for example, to draw
a live rabbit out of a top hat. Or was it a crow, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Many thanks,&rdquo; said
Alberto. He sat down.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Cheers!&rdquo; said Sophie, and
the guests raised their glasses and drank his health.</P>
<p>
They sat for a long time over their
chicken and salad. Suddenly Joanna got up, walked determinedly over
to Jeremy, and gave him a resounding kiss on the lips. He responded
by trying to topple her backward over the table so as to get a better
grip as he returned her kiss.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never ...&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Ingebrigtsen.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not on the table, children,&rdquo;
was Mrs. Amundsen&rsquo;s only comment.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Alberto,
turning toward her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was an odd question.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never wrong for a
real philosopher to ask questions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
A couple of the other boys who had not
been kissed started to throw chicken bones up on the roof. This, too,
elicited only a mild comment from Sophie&rsquo;s mother:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you mind not doing that.
It&rsquo;s such a nuisance when there are chicken bones in the
gutter.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said one of the
boys, whereupon they started throwing chicken bones over the garden
hedge instead.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time to
clear the plates away and serve the cake,&rdquo; said Mrs. Amundsen
finally. &ldquo;Sophie and Joanna, will you give me a hand?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
On their way to the kitchen there was
only time for a brief discussion.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What made you kiss him?&rdquo;
Sophie said to Joanna.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I sat looking at his mouth and
couldn&rsquo;t resist it. He is so cute!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How did it taste?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly like I&rsquo;d
imagined, but. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was the first time, then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But not the last!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Coffee and cake were soon on the
table. Alberto had started giving the boys some of his firecrackers
when Sophie&rsquo;s mother tapped on her coffee cup.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not going to make a long
speech,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;but I only have this one daughter,
and it is only this once that exactly one week and a day ago she
reached the age of fifteen. As you see, we have spared no expense.
There are twenty-four almond rings on the birthday cake, so there&rsquo;s
at least one whole ring for each of you. Those who help themselves
first can take two rings, because we start from the top and the rings
get bigger and bigger as you go. That&rsquo;s the way it is in life
too. When Sophie was a little girl, she went tripping around in tiny
little rings. But as the years went by, the rings got bigger and
bigger. Now they reach right over to the Old Town and back. And what
is more, with a father who is at sea so much, she makes calls to all
parts of the world. We congratulate you on your fifteenth birthday,
Sophie!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Delightful!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Ingebrigtsen.</P>
<p>
Sophie was not sure whether she was
referring to her mother, the speech, the birthday cake, or Sophie
herself.</P>
<p>
The guests applauded, and one of the
boys threw a firecracker up into the pear tree. Joanna left the table
and pulled Jeremy up off his chair. They lay down on the grass and
started kissing each other again. After a while they rolled in under
the red-currant bushes.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nowadays it&rsquo;s the girl
who takes the initiative,&rdquo; said Mr. Ingebrigtsen.</P>
<p>
Having said that, he got up and went
over to the red-currant bushes where he stood observing the
phenomenon at close quarters. The rest of the guests followed suit.
Only Sophie and Alberto remained sitting at the table. The other
guests now stood in a semicircle around Joanna and Jeremy.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be stopped,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Ingebrigtsen, not without a certain pride.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, generation follows
generation,&rdquo; said her husband.</P>
<p>
He looked around, expecting applause
for his well-chosen words. When the only response was a few silent
nods, he added: &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie saw from a distance that Jeremy
was trying to unbutton Joanna&rsquo;s white shirt, which was already
covered with green stains from the grass. She was fumbling with his
belt.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t catch cold!&rdquo;
said Mrs. Ingebrigtsen.</P>
<p>
Sophie looked despairingly at Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happening more
quickly than I thought,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have to get away
from here as soon as possible. I just have to make a short speech.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie clapped her hands loudly.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Could everyone please come back
and sit down again? Alberto is going to make a speech.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Everyone except Joanna and Jeremy came
drifting back to their places at the table.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you really going to make a
speech?&rdquo; asked He-lene Amundsen. &ldquo;How charming!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And you like going for walks, I
know. It is so important to stay in shape. And it&rsquo;s so much
nicer when you have a dog to keep you company. Hermes, isn&rsquo;t
that its name?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto stood up. &ldquo;Dear Sophie,&rdquo;
he began. &ldquo;Since this is a philosophical garden party, I will
make a philosophical speech.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
This was greeted by a burst of
applause.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In this riotous company, a dose
of reason might not be out of place. But whatever happens, let us not
forget to congratulate Sophie on her fifteenth birthday.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He had hardly finished these sentences
when they heard the drone of an approaching sports plane. It flew in
low over the garden. Behind it streamed a long tail banner saying:
&ldquo;Happy 15th birthday!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
This led to renewed applause, even
louder than before.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There, you see?&rdquo; Mrs.
Amundsen cried joyfully. &ldquo;This man can do more than set off
fireworks!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you. It was a mere
bagatelle. During the past few weeks, Sophie and I have carried out a
major philosophical investigation. We shall here and now reveal
our findings. We shall reveal the innermost secrets of our
existence.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The little gathering was now so quiet
that the only sounds were the twittering of the birds and a few
subdued noises from the red-currant bushes. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said
Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;After a thorough philosophical
study&mdash;which has led from the first Greek philosophers to the
present day&mdash;we have discovered that we are living our lives in
the mind of a major who is at this moment serving as a UN observer
in Lebanon. He has also written a book about us for his daughter back
in Lillesand. Her name is Hilde Mailer Knag, and she was fifteen
years old on the same day as Sophie. The book about us lay on her
bedside table when she woke up early on the morning of June 15. To be
more precise, it was in the form of a ring binder. Even as we speak,
she can feel the final pages of the ring binder under her index
finger.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
A feeling of apprehension had begun to
spread around the table.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Our existence is therefore
neither more nor less than a kind of birthday diversion for Hilde
Mailer Knag. We have all been invented as a framework for the major&rsquo;s
philosophical education of his daughter. This means, for example,
that the white Mercedes at the gate is not worth a cent. It&rsquo;s
just a bagatelle. It&rsquo;s worth no more than the white Mercedes
that drives around and around inside the head of a poor UN major, who
has just this minute sat down in the shade of a palm tree to avoid
getting sunstroke. The days are hot in Lebanon, my friends.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Garbage!&rdquo; exclaimed the
financial adviser. &ldquo;This is absolutely pure nonsense.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are welcome to your
opinion,&rdquo; Alberto continued unabashed, &ldquo;but the truth is
that it is this garden party which is absolutely pure nonsense. The
only dose of reason in the whole party is this speech.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
At that, the financial adviser got up
and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Here we are, trying our best to
run a business, and to make sure we have insurance coverage against
every kind of risk. Then along comes this know-it-all who tries to
destroy it all with his &lsquo;philosophical&rsquo; allegations.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto nodded in agreement.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There is indeed no insurance to
cover this kind of philosophical insight. We are talking of
something worse than a natural catastrophe, sir. But as you are
probably aware, insurance doesn&rsquo;t cover those either.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is not a natural
catastrophe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, it is an existential
catastrophe. For example, just take a look under the currant bushes
and you will see what I mean. You cannot insure yourself against the
collapse of your whole life. Neither can you insure yourself against
the sun going out.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do we have to put up with
this?&rdquo; asked Joanna&rsquo;s father, looking at his wife.</P>
<p>
She shook her head, and so did
Sophie&rsquo;s mother.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a shame,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and after we had spared no expense.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The younger guests continued to look
at Alberto. &ldquo;We want to hear more,&rdquo; said a curly-haired
boy with glasses.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, but there is not
much more to say. When you have realized that you are a dream image
in another person&rsquo;s sleepy consciousness, then, in my opinion,
it is wisest to be silent. But I can finish by recommending that you
take a short course in the history of philosophy. It is important to
be critical of the older generation&rsquo;s values. If I have tried
to teach Sophie anything, it is precisely that, to think critically.
Hegel called it thinking negatively.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The financial adviser was still
standing, drumming his fingers on the table.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This agitator is attempting to
break down all the sound values which the school and the church and
we ourselves are trying to instill in the younger generation. It is
they who have the future before them and who one day will inherit
everything we have built up. If this man is not immediately
removed from this gathering I intend to call our lawyer. He will know
how to deal with this situation.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It makes little difference
whether you deal with this situation or not, since you are nothing
but a shadow. Anyway, Sophie and I are about to leave the party,
since for us the philosophy course has not been purely theoretical.
It has also had its practical side. When the time is ripe we will
perform our disappearing act. That is how we are going to sneak our
way out of the major&rsquo;s consciousness.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Helene Amundsen took hold of her
daughter&rsquo;s arm.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You are not leaving me, are
you, Sophie?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie put her arms around her mother.
She looked up at Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Mom is so sad . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s just
ridiculous. Don&rsquo;t forget what you have learned. It&rsquo;s this
sort of nonsense we must liberate ourselves from. Your mother is
a sweet and kind lady, just as the Little Red Ridinghood who came to
my door that day had a basket filled with food for her grandmother.
Your mother is no more sad than the plane that just flew over needed
fuel for its congratulation maneuvers.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I see what you mean,&rdquo;
said Sophie, and turned back to her mother. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I
have to do what he says, Mom. One day I had to leave you.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to miss you,&rdquo;
said her mother, &ldquo;but if there is a heaven over this one,
you&rsquo;ll just have to fly. I promise to take good care of
Govinda. Does it eat one or two lettuce leaves a day?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto put his hand on her shoulder.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Neither you nor anyone else
here will miss us for the simple reason that you do not exist. You
are no more than shadows.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is the worst insult I&rsquo;ve
ever heard,&rdquo; Mrs. Ingebrigtsen burst out.</P>
<p>
Her husband nodded.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If nothing else, we can always
get him nailed for defamation of character. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s
a Communist. He wants to strip us of everything we hold dear. The
man&rsquo;s a scoundrel.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
With that, both Alberto and the
financial adviser sat down. The letter&rsquo;s face was crimson with
rage. Now Joanna and Jeremy also came and sat at the table. Their
clothes were grubby and crumpled. Joanna&rsquo;s golden hair was
caked with mud and earth.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;m going to have a
baby,&rdquo; she announced.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All right, but you&rsquo;ll
have to wait till you get home.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She had immediate support from her
husband. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll simply have to contain herself,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;And if there is to be a christening tonight, she&rsquo;ll
have to arrange it herself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto looked down at Sophie with a
somber expression.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you at least bring
us a little more coffee before you go?&rdquo; asked her mother.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course, Mom, I&rsquo;ll do
it right away.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie took the thermos from the
table. She had to make more coffee. While she stood waiting for it to
brew, she fed the birds and the goldfish. She also went into the
bathroom and put a lettuce leaf out for Govinda. She couldn&rsquo;t
see the cat anywhere, but she opened a large can of cat food, emptied
it into a bowl and set it out on the step. She felt her tears welling
up.</P>
<p>
When she returned with the coffee, the
garden party looked more like a children&rsquo;s party than a young
woman&rsquo;s philosophical celebration. Several soda bottles had
been knocked over on the table, there was chocolate cake smeared all
over the tablecloth and the dish of raisin buns lay upside down on
the lawn. Just as Sophie arrived, one of the boys put a firecracker
to the layer cake, which exploded all over the table and the
guests. The worst casualty was Mrs. Ingebrigtsen&rsquo;s red
pants suit. The curious thing was that both she and everybody else
took it with the utmost calm. Joanna picked up a huge piece of
chocolate cake, smeared it all over Jeremy&rsquo;s face, and
proceeded to lick it off again.</P>
<p>
Her mother and Alberto were sitting in
the glider a little way away from the others. They waved to Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So you finally had your
confidential talk,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And you were perfectly right,&rdquo;
said her mother, quite elated now. &ldquo;Alberto is a very
altruistic person. I entrust you to his strong arms.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie sat down between them.</P>
<p>
Two of the boys had managed to climb
onto the roof. One of the girls went around pricking holes in all the
balloons with a hairpin. Then an uninvited guest arrived on a
motorcycle with a crate of beer and bottles of aquavit strapped to
the carrier. A few helpful souls welcomed him in.</P>
<p>
At that, the financial adviser rose
from the table. He clapped his hands and said:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you want to play a game?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He grabbed a bottle of beer, drank it
down, and set the empty bottle in the middle of the lawn. Then he
went to the table and fetched the last five rings of the birthday
cake. He showed the other guests how to throw the rings so they
landed over the neck of the bottle.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The death throes,&rdquo; said
Alberto. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get away before the major ends it
all and Hilde closes the ring binder.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to clear up
alone, Mom.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, child.
This was no life for you. If Alberto can give you a better one,
nobody will be happier than I. Didn&rsquo;t you tell me he had a
white horse?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie looked out across the garden.
It was unrecognizable. Bottles, chicken bones, buns, and
balloons were trampled into the grass.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This was once my little Garden
of Eden,&rdquo; she said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re being
driven out of it,&rdquo; said Alberto.</P>
<p>
One of the boys was sitting in the
white Mercedes. He revved the engine and the car smashed through the
garden gate, up the gravel path, and down into the garden.</P>
<p>
Sophie felt a hard grip on her arm as
she was dragged into the den. Then she heard Alberto&rsquo;s voice:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
At the same moment the white Mercedes
crashed into an apple tree. Unripe fruit showered down onto the hood.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s going too far!&rdquo;
shouted the financial adviser. &ldquo;I demand substantial
compensation!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
His wife gave him her full support.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that damned
scoundrel&rsquo;s fault! Where is he?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They have vanished into thin
air,&rdquo; said Helene Amundsen, not without a touch of pride.</P>
<p>
She drew herself up to her full
height, walked toward the long table and began to clear up after the
philosophical garden party.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;More coffee, anyone?&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>Counterpoint</h3><br />
<p>
&hellip;two or more melodies sounding together&hellip;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Hilde sat up in bed. That was the end of the story of Sophie and
Alberto. But what had actually happened?</P>
<p>
Why had her father written that last chapter? Was it just to
demonstrate his power over Sophie&rsquo;s world?</P>
<p>
Deep in thought, she took a shower and got dressed. She ate a quick
breakfast and then wandered down the garden and sat in the glider.</P>
<p>
She agreed with Alberto that the only sensible thing that had
happened at the garden party was his speech. Surely her father didn&rsquo;t
think Hilde&rsquo;s world was as chaotic as Sophie&rsquo;s
garden party? Or that her world would also dissolve eventually?</P>
<p>
Then there was the matter of Sophie and Alberto. What had happened to
the secret plan?</P>
<p>
Was it up to Hilde herself to continue the story? Or had they really
managed to sneak out of it?</P>
<p>
And where were they now?</P>
<p>
A thought suddenly struck her. If Alberto and Sophie really had
managed to sneak out of the story, there wouldn&rsquo;t be anything
about it in the ring binder. Everything that was there,
unfortunately, was clear to her father.</P>
<p>
Could there be anything written between the lines? There was more
than a mere suggestion of it. Hilde realized that she would have
to read the whole story again one or two more times.</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>

<p>

</P>
<p>
As the white Mercedes drove into the
garden, Alberto dragged Sophie with him into the den. Then they ran
into the woods in the direction of the major&rsquo;s cabin.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Quickly!&rdquo; cried Alberto.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to happen before he starts looking for us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are we beyond the major&rsquo;s
reach now?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We are in the borderland.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They rowed across the water and ran
into the cabin. Alberto opened a trapdoor in the floor. He pushed
Sophie down into the cellar. Then everything went black.</P>
<p>
In the days that followed, Hilde worked on her plan. She sent several
letters to Anne Kvamsdal in Copenhagen, and a couple of times she
called her. She also enlisted the aid of friends and acquaintances,
and recruited almost half of her class at school.</P>
<p>
In between, she read Sophie&rsquo;s World. It was not a story one
could be done with after a single reading. New thoughts about what
could have happened to Sophie and Alberto when they left the garden
party were constantly occurring to her.</P>
<p>
On Saturday, June 23, she awoke with a start around nine o&rsquo;clock.
She knew her father had already left the camp in Lebanon. Now it was
just a question of waiting. The last part of his day was planned down
to the smallest detail.</P>
<p>
Later in the morning she began the preparations for Midsummer Eve
with her mother. Hilde could not help thinking of how Sophie and her
mother had arranged their Midsummer Eve party. But that was something
they had done. It was over, finished. Or was it? Were they going
around right now, decorating everywhere?</P>
<p>
Sophie and Alberto seated themselves
on a lawn in front of two large buildings with ugly air vents and
ventilation canals on the outside. A young couple came walking out of
one of the buildings. He was carrying a brown briefcase and she
had a red handbag slung over one shoulder. A car drove along a
narrow road in the background.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked
Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We made it!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;But where are we?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is Oslo.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you quite sure?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite sure. One of these
buildings is called Chateau Neuf, which means &lsquo;the new palace.&rsquo;
People study music there. The other is the Congregation Faculty. It&rsquo;s
a school of theology. Further up the hill they study science and up
at the top they study literature and philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Are we out of Hilde&rsquo;s
book and beyond the major&rsquo;s control?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, both. He&rsquo;ll never
find us here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But where were we when we ran
through the woods?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;While the major was busy
crashing the financial adviser&rsquo;s car into an apple tree,
we seized the chance to hide in the den. We were then at the embryo
stage. We were of the old as well as of the new world. But
concealing ourselves there was something the major cannot
possibly have envisaged.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;He would never have let us go
so easily. As it was, it went like a dream. Of course, there&rsquo;s
always the chance that he was in on it himself.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was he who started the white
Mercedes. He may have exerted himself to the utmost to lose sight of
us. He was probably utterly exhausted after everything that had been
going on . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
By now the young couple were only a
few yards away. Sophie felt a bit awkward, sitting on the grass with
a man so much older than herself. Besides, she wanted someone to
confirm what Alberto had said.</P>
<p>
She got up and went over to them</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me, would you mind
telling me the name of this street?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
But they ignored her completely.</P>
<p>
Sophie was so provoked that she asked
them again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s customary to answer
a person, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The young man was clearly engrossed in
explaining something to his companion:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Contrapuntal form operates on
two dimensions, horizontally, or melodically, and vertically, or
harmonically.</P>
<p>
There will always be two or more
melodies sounding together . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me for interrupting,
but. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The melodies combine in such a
way that they develop as much as possible, independently of how they
sound against each other. But they have to be concordant. Actually
it&rsquo;s note against note.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
How rude! They were neither deaf nor
blind. Sophie tried a third time, standing ahead of them on the path
blocking their way,</P>
<p>
She was simply brushed aside.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wind coming
up,&rdquo; said the woman.</P>
<p>
Sophie rushed back to Alberto.</P>
<p>
&lsquo;They can&rsquo;t hear me!&rdquo;
she said desperately&mdash;and just as she said it, she recalled her
dream about Hilde and the gold crucifix.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the price we have to
pay. Although we have sneaked out of a book, we can&rsquo;t expect to
nave exactly the same status as its author. But we really are here.
From now on, we will never be a day older than we were when we left
the philosophical garden party.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does that mean we&rsquo;ll
never have any real contact with me people around us?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A true philosopher never says
&lsquo;never.&rsquo; What time is it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The same as when we left
Captain&rsquo;s Bend, of course.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This is the day Hilde&rsquo;s
father gets back from Lebanon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we must
hurry.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you anxious to
know what happens when the major gets home to Bjerkely?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Naturally, but. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Come on, then!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They began to walk down toward the
city. Several people passed them on the way, but they all walked
right on by as if Sophie and Alberto were invisible.</P>
<p>
Cars were parked by the curbside all
the way along the street. Alberto stopped by a small red convertible
with the top down.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We must just make sure it&rsquo;s ours.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no idea what you mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better explain then.
We can&rsquo;t just take an ordinary car that belongs to someone here
in the city. What do you think would happen when people noticed the
car driving along without a driver? And anyway, we probably
wouldn&rsquo;t be able to start it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then why the convertible?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I recognize it from an
old movie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;m
getting tired of all these cryptic remarks.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a make-believe car,
Sophie. It&rsquo;s just like us. People here only see a vacant space.
That&rsquo;s all we have to confirm before we&rsquo;re on our
way.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They stood by the car and waited.
After a while, a boy came cycling along on the sidewalk. He turned
suddenly and rode right through the red car and onto the road.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There, you see? It&rsquo;s
ours!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto opened the door to the
passenger seat.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Be my guest!&rdquo; he said,
and Sophie got in.</P>
<p>
He got into the driver&rsquo;s seat.
The key was in the ignition, he turned it, and the engine started.</P>
<p>
They drove southward out of the city,
past Lysaker, Sandvika, Drammen, and down toward Lillesand. As they
drove they saw more and more Midsummer bonfires, especially
after they had passed Drammen.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Midsummer, Sophie.
Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s such a lovely
fresh breeze in an open car. Is it true that no one can see us?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Only people of our own kind. We
might meet some of them. What&rsquo;s the time now?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Half past eight.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take a few
shortcuts. We can&rsquo;t stay behind this trailer, that&rsquo;s
for sure.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They turned off into a large
wheatfield. Sophie looked back and saw that they had left a broad
trail of flattened stalks.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Tomorrow they&rsquo;ll say a
freak wind blew over the field,&rdquo; said Alberto.</P>

</P>
<p>
Major Albert Knag had just landed at Kastrup Airport outside
Copenhagen. It was half past four on Saturday, June 23. It had
already been a long day. This penultimate lap had been by plane from
Rome.</P>
<p>
He went through passport control in his UN uniform, which he was
proud to wear. He represented not only himself and his country.
Albert Knag represented an international legal system&mdash;a
century-old tradition that now embraced the entire planet.</P>
<p>
He carried only a flight bag. He had checked the rest of his baggage
through from Rome. He just needed to hold up his red passport.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing to declare.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Major Albert Knag had a nearly three-hour wait in the airport before
his plane left for Kristiansand. He would have time to buy a few
presents for his family. He had sent the present of his life to Hilde
two weeks ago. Marit, his wife, had put it on her bedside table for
her to discover when she woke up on her birthday. He had not spoken
with Hilde since that late night birthday call.</P>
<p>
Albert bought a couple of Norwegian newspapers, found himself a table
in the bar, and ordered a cup of coffee. He had hardly had time to
skim the headlines when he heard an announcement over the
loudspeakers: &ldquo;This is a personal call for Albert Knag. Albert
Knag is requested to contact the SAS information desk.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
What now? He felt a chill down his spine. Surely he was not being
ordered back to Lebanon? Could something be wrong at home?</P>
<p>
He quickly reached the SAS information desk.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Albert Knag.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Here is a message for you. It is urgent.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He opened the envelope at once. Inside lay a smaller envelope. It was
addressed to Major Albert Knag, c/o SAS Information, Kastrup Airport,
Copenhagen.</P>
<p>
Albert opened the little envelope nervously. It contained a
short note:</P>
<p>
Dear Dad, Welcome home from Lebanon. As you can imagine, I can&rsquo;t
even wait till you get home. Forgive me for having you paged over the
loud-speakers. It was the easiest way.</P>
<p>
P.S. Unfortunately a claim for damages has arrived from
financial adviser Ingebrigtsen regarding a stolen and wrecked
Mercedes.</P>
<p>
P.S. P.S. I may be sitting in the garden when you get here. But you
might also be hearing from me before that.</P>
<p>
P.S. P.S. P.S. I&rsquo;m rather scared of staying in the garden too
long at a time. It&rsquo;s so easy to sink into the ground in such
places. Love from Hilde, who has had plenty of time to prepare your
homecoming.</P>
<p>
Major Albert Knag&rsquo;s first impulse was to smile. But he did not
appreciate being manipulated in this manner. He had always liked to
be in charge of his own life. Now this little vixen in Lillesand was
directing his movements in Kastrup Airport! How had she managed that?</P>
<p>
He put the envelope in his breast pocket and began to stroll toward
the little shopping mall. He was just about to enter the Danish Food
deli when he noticed a small envelope taped to the store window. It
had MAJOR KNAG written on it with a thick marker pen. Albert took it
down and opened it:</P>
<p>
Personal message for Major Albert Knag, c/o Danish Food, Kastrup
Airport. Dear Dad, please buy a large Danish salami, preferably a
two-pound one, and Mom would probably like a cognac sausage. P. S.
Danish caviar is not bad either. Love, Hilde.</P>
<p>
Albert turned around. She wasn&rsquo;t here, was she? Had Mark given
her a trip to Copenhagen so she could meet him here? It was Hilde&rsquo;s
handwriting ...</P>
<p>
Suddenly the UN observer began to feel himself observed. It was
as if someone was in remote control of everything he did. He felt
like a doll in the hands of a child.</P>
<p>
He went into the shop and bought a two-pound salami, a cognac
sausage, and three jars of Danish caviar. Then he continued down the
row of stores. He had made up his mind to buy a proper present for
Hilde. A calculator, maybe? Or a little radio&mdash;yes, that was
what he would get.</P>
<p>
When he got to the store that sold electrical appliances, he saw
that there was an envelope taped to the window there too. This one
was addressed to &ldquo;Major Albert Knag, c/o the most interesting
store in Kastrup.&rdquo; Inside was the following note:</P>
<p>
Dear Dad, Sophie sends her greetings and thanks for the combined
mini-TV and FM radio that she got for her birthday from her very
generous father. It was great, but on the other hand it was a mere
bagatelle. I must confess, though, that I share Sophie&rsquo;s
liking for such bagatelles. P.S. In case you haven&rsquo;t been there
yet, there are further instructions at the Danish Food store and the
big Tax Free store that sells wines and tobacco. P.S. P.S. I got some
money for my birthday, so I can contribute to the mini-TV with 350
crowns. Love, Hilde, who has already stuffed the turkey and made the
Waldorf salad.</P>
<p>
A mini-TV cost 985 Danish crowns. That could certainly be called a
bagatelle in comparison with how Albert Knag felt about being
directed hither and thither by his daughter&rsquo;s sneaky tricks.
Was she here&mdash;or was she not?</P>
<p>
From that moment on, he was constantly on guard wherever he went. He
felt like a secret agent and a marionette rolled into one. Was
he not being deprived of his basic human rights?</P>
<p>
He felt obliged to go into the Tax Free store as well. There hung a
new envelope with his name on it. The whole airport was becoming a
computer game with him as the cursor. He read the message:</P>
<p>
Major Knag, c/o the Tax Free store at Kastrup. All I need from here
is a bag of gumdrops and some marzipan bars. Remember it&rsquo;s much
more expensive in Norway. As far as I can recall, Mom is very
fond of Campari. P.S. You must keep all your senses alert the whole
way home. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss any important messages,
would you? Love from your most teachable daughter, Hilde.</P>
<p>
Albert sighed despairingly, but he went into the store and shopped as
instructed. With three plastic carriers and his flight bag he walked
toward Gate 28 to wait for his flight. If there were any more
messages they would have to stay there.</P>
<p>
However, at Gate 28 he caught sight of another white envelope taped
to a pillar: &ldquo;To Major Knag, c/o GATE 28, Kastrup Airport.&rdquo;
This was also in Hilde&rsquo;s handwriting, but the gate number
seemed to have been written by someone else. It was not easy to
judge since there was no writing to compare it with, only block
letters and digits. He took it down. This one said only &ldquo;It
won&rsquo;t be long now.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
He sat down on a chair with his back against the wall. He kept the
shopping bags on his knees. Thus the proud major sat stiffly, eyes
straight ahead, like a small child traveling alone for the first
time. If Hilde was here, she was certainly not going to have the
satisfaction of discovering him first.</P>
<p>
He glanced anxiously at each passenger that came in. For a while he
felt like an enemy of the state under close surveillance. When the
passengers were finally allowed to board the plane he breathed a sigh
of relief. He was the last person to board. As he handed over his
boarding pass he tore off another white envelope that had been taped
to the check-in desk.</P>
<p>
Sophie and Alberto had passed Brevik,
and a little later the exit to Kragera.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going awfully
fasf,&rdquo; said Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost nine o&rsquo;clock.
He&rsquo;ll soon be landing at Kjevik. But we won&rsquo;t be stopped
for speeding.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Suppose we smash into another
car?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It makes no difference if it&rsquo;s
just an ordinary car. But if it&rsquo;s one of our own . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to be
very careful. Didn&rsquo;t you notice that we passed the Bat Mobile.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was parked somewhere up in
Vestfold.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;This tourist bus won&rsquo;t be
easy to pass. There are dense woods on each side of the road.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It makes no difference, Sophie.
Can&rsquo;t you get it into your head?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
So saying, he swung the car into the
woods and drove straight through the trees.</P>
<p>
Sophie breathed a sigh of relief.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You scared me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t feel it if we
drove into a brick wall.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That only means we&rsquo;re
spirits of the air compared to our surroundings.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, now you&rsquo;re putting
the cart before the horse. It is the reality around us that&rsquo;s
an airy adventure to us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Listen carefully, then. It is a
widespread misunderstanding that spirit is a thing that is more
&lsquo;airy&rsquo; than vapor. On the contrary. Spirit is more solid
than ice.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That never occurred to me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ll tell you a
story. Once upon a time there was a man who didn&rsquo;t believe in
angels. One day, while he was out working in the woods, he was
visited by an angel.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They walked together for a
while. Then the man turned to the angel and said, &lsquo;All right,
now I have to admit that angels exist. But you don&rsquo;t exist in
reality, like us.&rdquo;What do you mean by that?&rsquo; asked the
angel. So the man answered, &lsquo;When we came to that big
rock, I had to go around it, but I noticed that you just glided
through it. And when we came to that huge log that lay across the
path, I had to climb over it while you walked straight through it.&rsquo;
The angel was very surprised, and said &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you also
notice that we took a path that led through a marsh? We both walked
right through the mist. That was because we were more solid than the
mist.&rsquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same with us,
Sophie. Spirit can pass through steel doors. No tanks or bombers can
crush anything that is of spirit.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a comfort.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon be passing
Ris0r, and it&rsquo;s no more than an hour since we left the major&rsquo;s
cabin. I could really use a cup of coffee.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
When they got to Fiane, just before
S0ndeled, they passed a cafeteria on the lefthand side of the road.
It was called Cinderella. Alberto swung the car around and parked on
the grass in front of it.</P>
<p>
Inside, Sophie tried to take a bottle
of Coke from the cooler, but she couldn&rsquo;t lift it. It seemed to
be stuck. Further down the counter, Alberto was trying to tap coffee
into a paper cup he had found in the car. He only had to press a
lever, but even by exerting all his strength he could not press it
down.</P>
<p>
This made him so mad that he turned to
the cafeteria guests and asked for help. When no one reacted, he
shouted so loudly that Sophie had to cover her ears: &ldquo;I want
some coffee!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
His anger soon evaporated, and he
doubled up with laughter. They were about to turn around and leave
when an old woman got up from her chair and came toward them.</P>
<p>
She was wearing a garish red skirt, an
ice-blue cardigan, and a white kerchief round her head. She
seemed more sharply defined than anything else in the little
cafeteria.</P>
<p>
She went up to Alberto and said, &ldquo;My
my, how you do yell, my boy!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You want some coffee, you
said?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We have a small establishment
close by.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They followed the old woman out of the
cafeteria and down a path behind it. While they walked, she said,
&ldquo;You are new in these parts?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We might as well admit it,&rdquo;
answered Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Welcome
to eternity then, children.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of one of Grimm&rsquo;s
fairy tales. That was nearly two hundred years ago. And where are you
from?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of a book on
philosophy. I am the philosophy teacher and this is my student,
Sophie.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hee hee! That&rsquo;s a new
one!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They came through the trees to a small
clearing where there were several cozy-looking brown cottages. A
large Midsummer bonfire was burning in a yard between the cottages,
and around the bonfire danced a crowd of colorful figures.
Sophie recognized many of them. There were Snow White and some of the
seven dwarfs, Mary Poppins and Sherlock Holmes, Peter Pan and Pippi
Longstocking, Little Red Ridinghood and Cinderella. A lot of familiar
figures without names had also gathered around the bonfire&mdash;there
were gnomes and elves, fauns and witches, angels and imps. Sophie
also caught sight of a real live troll.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What a lot of noise!&rdquo;
exclaimed Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s
Midsummer,&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had a
gathering like this since Valborg&rsquo;s Eve. That was when we were
in Germany. I&rsquo;m only here on a short visit. Was it coffee you
wanted?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Not until now did Sophie notice that
all the buildings were made out of gingerbread, candy, and sugar
icing. Several of the figures were eating directly off the facades. A
baker was going around repairing the damage as it occurred. Sophie
ventured to take a little bite off one corner. It tasted sweeter
and better than anything she had ever tasted before.</P>
<p>
Presently the old woman returned with
a cup of coffee.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you very much indeed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And what are the visitors going
to pay for the coffee?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To pay?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We usually pay with a story.
For coffee, an old wives&rsquo; tale will suffice.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We could tell the whole
incredible story of humanity,&rdquo; said Alberto, &ldquo;but
unfortunately we are in a hurry. Can we come back and pay some other
day?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course. And why are you in a
hurry?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto explained their errand, and
the old woman commented:</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;I must say, you certainly are
a pair of greenhorns. You&rsquo;d better hurry up and cut the
umbilical cord to your mortal progenitor. We no longer need their
world. We belong to the invisible people.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto and Sophie hurried back to the
Cinderella cafeteria and the red convertible. Right next to the
car a busy mother was helping her little boy to pee.</P>
<p>
Racing along and taking shortcuts,
they soon arrived in Lillesand.</P>
<p>
SK 876 from Copenhagen touched down at Kjevik on schedule at 9:35
p.m. While the plane was taxied out to the runway in Copenhagen,
the.major had opened the envelope hanging from the check-in desk. The
note inside read:</P>
<p>
To Major Knag, as he hands over his boarding pass at Kastrup on
Midsummer Eve, 1990. Dear Dad, You probably thought I would turn up
in Copenhagen. But my control over your movements is more
ingenious than that. I can see you wherever you are, Dad. The fact
is, I have been to visit a well-known Gypsy family which many, many
years ago sold a magic brass mirror to Great-grandmother. I have also
gotten myself a crystal ball. At this very moment, I can see that you
have just sat down in your seat. May I remind you to fasten your seat
belt and keep the back of your seat raised to an upright position
until the Fasten Seat Belt sign has been switched off. As soon as the
plane is in flight, you can lower the seat back and give yourself a
well-earned rest. You will need to be rested when you get home. The
weather in Lillesand is perfect, but the temperature is a few
degrees lower than in Lebanon. I wish you a pleasant flight.
Love, your own witch-daughter, Queen of the Mirror and the Highest
Protector of Irony.</P>
<p>
Albert could not quite make out whether he was angry or merely tired
and resigned. Then he started laughing. He laughed so loudly that his
fellow passengers turned to stare at him. Then the plane took off.</P>
<p>
He had been given a taste of his own medicine. But with a significant
difference, surely. His medicine had first and foremost affected
Sophie and Alberto. And they&mdash;well, they were only imaginary.</P>
<p>
He did what Hilde had suggested. He lowered the back of his seat and
nodded off. He was not fully awake again until he had gone through
passport control and was standing in the arrival hall at Kjevik
Airport. A demonstration was there to greet him.</P>
<p>
There were eight or ten young people of about Hilde&rsquo;s age. They
were holding signs saying: WELCOME HOME,</P>
<p>
DAD &mdash; HILDE IS WAITING IN THE GARDEN &mdash; IRONY LIVES.</P>
<p>
The worst thing was that he could not just jump into a taxi. He had
to wait for his baggage. And all the while, Hilde&rsquo;s classmates
were swarming around him, forcing him to read the signs again and
again. Then one of the girls came up and gave him a bunch of roses
and he melted. He dug down into one of his shopping bags and gave
each demonstrator a marzipan bar. Now there were only two left for
Hilde. When he had reclaimed his baggage, a young man stepped
forward and explained that he was under the command of the Queen of
the Mirror, and that he had orders to drive him to Bjerkely. The
other demonstrators dispersed into the crowd.</P>
<p>
They drove out onto the E 18. Every bridge and tunnel they passed was
draped with banners saying: &ldquo;Welcome home!&rdquo;, &ldquo;The
turkey is ready,&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can see you, Dad!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
When he was dropped off outside the gate at Bjerkely, Albert Knag
heaved a sigh of relief, and thanked the driver with a hundred crown
note and three cans of Carlsberg Elephant beer.</P>
<p>
His wife was waiting for him outside the house. After a long embrace,
he asked: &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s sitting on the dock, Albert.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Alberto and Sophie stopped the red
convertible on the square in Lillesand outside the Hotel Norge. It
was a quarter past ten. They could see a large bonfire out in
the archipelago.</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;How do we find Bjerkely?&rdquo;
asked Sophie.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to hunt
around for it. You remember the painting in the major&rsquo;s cabin.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to hurry. I
want to get there before he arrives.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They started to drive around the minor
roads and then over rocky mounds and slopes. A useful clue was that
Bjerkely lay by the water.</P>
<p>
Suddenly Sophie shouted, &ldquo;There
it is! We&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I do believe you&rsquo;re
right, but don&rsquo;t shout so loud.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Why? There&rsquo;s no one to
hear us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Sophie&mdash;after a
whole course in philosophy, I&rsquo;m very disappointed to find you
still jumping to conclusions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but. . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t believe
this place is entirely devoid of trolls, pixies, wood nymphs, and
good fairies?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, excuse me.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They drove through the gate and up the
gravel path to the house. Alberto parked the car on the lawn beside
the glider. A little way down the garden a table was set for three.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can see her!&rdquo; whispered
Sophie. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sitting down on the dock, just like in my
dream.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you noticed how much the
garden looks like your own garden in Clover Close?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it does. With the glider
and everything. Can I go down to her?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Naturally. I&rsquo;ll stay
here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie ran down to the dock. She
almost stumbled and fell over Hilde. But she sat down politely beside
her.</P>
<p>
Hilde sat idly playing with the line
that the rowboat was made fast with. In her left hand she held a slip
of paper. She was clearly waiting. She glanced at her watch several
times.</P>
<p>
Sophie thought she was very pretty.
She had fair, curly hair and bright green eyes. She was wearing a
yellow summer dress. She was not unlike Joanna.</P>
<p>
Sophie tried to talk to her even
though she knew it was useless.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde&mdash;it&rsquo;s Sophie!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde gave no sign that she had heard.</P>
<p>
Sophie got onto her knees and tried to
shout in her ear:</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you hear me, Hilde? Or are
you both deaf and blind?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Did she, or didn&rsquo;t she, open her
eyes a little wider? Wasn&rsquo;t there a very slight sign that she
had heard something&mdash;however faintly?</P>
<p>
She looked around. Then she turned her
head sharply and stared right into Sophie&rsquo;s eyes. She did not
focus on her properly; it was as if she was looking right through
her.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Not so loud, Sophie,&rdquo;
said Alberto from up in the car. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the garden
filled with mermaids.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie sat still now. It felt good
just to be close to Hilde.</P>
<p>
Then she heard the deep voice of a
man: &ldquo;Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
It was the major&mdash;in uniform,
with a blue beret. He stood at the top of the garden.</P>
<p>
Hilde jumped up and ran toward him.
They met between the glider and the red convertible. He lifted
her up in the air and swung her around and around.</P>
<p>
Hilde had been sitting on the dock waiting for her father. Since he
had landed at Kastrup, she had thought of him every fifteen minutes,
trying to imagine where he was now, and how he was taking it. She had
noted all the times down on a slip of paper and kept it with her all
day.</P>
<p>
What if it made him angry? But surely he couldn&rsquo;t expect that
he would write a mysterious book for her&mdash; and then everything
would remain as before?</P>
<p>
She looked at her watch again. Now it was a quarter past ten. He
could be arriving any minute.</P>
<p>
But what was that? She thought she heard a faint breath of something,
exactly as in her dream about Sophie.</P>
<p>
She turned around quickly. There was something, she was sure of it.
But what?</P>
<p>
Maybe it was only the summer night.</P>
<p>
For a few seconds she was afraid she was hearing things.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Now she turned the other way. It was Dad! He was standing at the top
of the garden.</P>
<p>
Hilde jumped up and ran toward him. They met by the glider. He lifted
her up in the air and swung her around and around.</P>
<p>
Hilde was crying, and her father had to hold back his tears as well.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become a grown woman, Hilde!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve become a real writer.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde wiped away her tears.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall we say we&rsquo;re quits?&rdquo; she asked.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re quits.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They sat down at the table. First of all Hilde had to have an exact
description of everything that had happened at Kastrup and on
the way home. They kept bursting out laughing.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see the envelope in the cafeteria?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to sit down and eat anything, you
villain. Now I&rsquo;m ravenous.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor Dad.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The stuff about the turkey was all bluff, then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It certainly was not! I have prepared everything. Mom&rsquo;s
doing the serving.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Then they had to go over the ring binder and the story of Sophie and
Alberto from one end to the other and backwards and forwards.</P>
<p>
Mom brought out the turkey and the Waldorf salad, the rose wine and
Hilde&rsquo;s homemade bread.</P>
<p>
Her father was just saying something about Plato when Hilde suddenly
interrupted him: &ldquo;Shh!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear it? Something squeaking?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I heard something. I guess it was just a field
mouse.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
While her mother went to get another bottle of wine, her father said:
&ldquo;But the philosophy course isn&rsquo;t quite over.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Tonight I&rsquo;m going to tell you about the universe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Before they began to eat, he said to his wife, &ldquo;Hilde is too
big to sit on my knee any more. But you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; With
that he caught Marit round the waist and drew her onto his lap. It
was quite a while before she got anything to eat.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;To think you&rsquo;ll soon be forty ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
When Hilde jumped up and ran toward
her father, Sophie felt her tears welling up. She would never be able
to reach her . . .</P>
<p>
Sophie was deeply envious of Hilde
because she had been created a real person of flesh and blood.</P>
<p>
When Hilde and the major had sat down
at the table, Alberto honked the car horn.</P>
<p>
Sophie looked up. Didn&rsquo;t Hilde
do exactly the same?</P>
<p>
She ran up to Alberto and jumped into
the seat next to him.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sit for a while and
watch what happens,&rdquo; he said.</P>
<p>
Sophie nodded.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you been crying?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She nodded again.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so lucky to be a
real person. Now she&rsquo;ll grow up and be a real woman. I&rsquo;m
sure she&rsquo;ll have real children too . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And grandchildren, Sophie. But
there are two sides to everything. That was what I tried to teach you
at the beginning of our course.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;She is lucky, I agree. But she
who wins the lot of life must also draw the lot of death, since the
lot of life is death.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But still, isn&rsquo;t it
better to have had a life than never to have really lived?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We cannot live a life like
Hilde&mdash;or like the major for that matter. On the other hand,
we&rsquo;ll never die. Don&rsquo;t you remember what the old woman
said back there in the woods? We are the invisible people. She was
two hundred years old, she said. And at their Midsummer party I
saw some creatures who were more than three thousand years old . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;Perhaps what I envy most about
Hilde is all this ... her family life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you have a family yourself.
And you have a cat, two birds, and a tortoise.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But we left all that behind,
didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;By no means. It&rsquo;s only
the major who left it behind. He has written the final word of his
book, my dear, and he will never find us again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Does that mean we can go back?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Anytime we want. But we&rsquo;re
also going to make new friends in the woods behind Cinderella&rsquo;s
cafeteria.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The Knag family began their meal. For
a moment Sophie was afraid it would turn out like the
philosophical garden party in Clover Close. At one point it looked as
though the major intended to lay Marit across the table. But then he
drew her on to his knee instead.</P>
<p>
The car was parked a good way away
from where the family sat eating. Their conversation was only audible
now and then. Sophie and Alberto sat gazing down over the garden.
They had plenty of time to mull over all the details and the sorry
ending of the garden party.</P>
<p>
The family did not get up from the
table until almost midnight. Hilde and the major strolled toward the
glider. They waved to Marit as she walked up to the white-painted
house.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You might as well go to bed,
Mom. We have so much to talk about.&rdquo;</P>
<br /><h3>The Big Bang</h3><br />
<p>
... we too are stardust. . .</P>
<p>
Hilde settled herself comfortably in the glider beside her father. It
was nearly midnight. They sat looking out across the bay. A few stars
glimmered palely in the light sky. Gentle waves lapped over the
stones under the dock.</P>
<p>
Her father broke the silence.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange thought that we live on a tiny little
planet in the universe.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Earth is only one of many planets orbiting the sun. Yet Earth
is the only living planet.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps the only one in the entire universe?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible. But it&rsquo;s also possible that the
universe is teeming with life. The universe is inconceivably huge.
The distances are so great that we measure them in light-minutes and
light-years.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What are they, actually?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A light-minute is the distance light travels in one minute.
And that&rsquo;s a long way, because light travels through space at
300,000 kilometers a second. That means that a light-minute is 60
times 300,000&mdash;or 18 million kilometers. A light-year is nearly
ten trillion kilometers.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How far away is the sun?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little over eight light-minutes away. The rays of
sunlight warming our faces on a hot June day have traveled for eight
minutes through the universe before they reach us.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Pluto, which is the planet farthest out in our solar system,
is about five light-hours away from us. When an astronomer looks at
Pluto through his telescope, he is in fact looking five hours back in
time. We could also say that the picture of Pluto takes five hours to
get here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit hard to visualize, but I think I understand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, Hilde. But we here on Earth are only just
beginning to orient ourselves. Our own sun is one of 400 billion
other stars in the galaxy we call the Milky Way. This galaxy
resembles a large discus, with our sun situated in one of its several
spiral arms. When we look up at the sky on a clear winter&rsquo;s
night, we see a broad band of stars. This is because we are looking
toward the center of the Milky Way.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s why the Milky Way is called &lsquo;Winter
Street&rsquo; in Swedish.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The distance to the star in the Milky Way that is our nearest
neighbor is four light-years. Maybe that&rsquo;s it just above the
island over there. If you could imagine that at this very moment a
stargazer is sitting up there with a powerful telescope pointing at
Bjerkely&mdash;he would see Bjerkely as it looked four years ago. He
might see an eleven-year-old girl swinging her legs in the glider.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Incredible.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s only the nearest star. The whole galaxy&mdash;
or nebula, as we also call it&mdash;is 90,000 light-years wide. That
is another way of describing the time it takes for light to travel
from one end of the galaxy to the other. When we gaze at a star in
the Milky Way which is 50,000 light-years away from our sun, we are
looking back 50,000 years in time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The idea is much too big for my little head.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The only way we can look out into space, then, is to look back
in time. We can never know what the universe is like now. We
only know what it was like then. When we look up at a star that is
thousands of light-years away, we are really traveling thousands of
years back in the history of space.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s completely incomprehensible.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But everything we see meets the eye in the form of light
waves. And these light waves take time to travel through space. We
could compare it to thunder. We always hear the thunder after we
have seen the lightning. That&rsquo;s because sound waves travel
slower than light waves. When I hear a peal of thunder, I&rsquo;m
hearing the sound of something that happened a little while ago. It&rsquo;s
the same thing with the stars. When I look at a star that is
thousands of light-years away, I&rsquo;m seeing the &lsquo;peal of
thunder&rsquo; from an event that lies thousands of years back in
time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But so far, we&rsquo;ve only been talking about our own
galaxy. Astronomers say there are about a hundred billion of
such galaxies in the universe, and each of these galaxies consists of
about a hundred billion stars. We call the nearest galaxy to the
Milky Way the Andromeda nebula. It lies two million light-years from
our own galaxy. That means the light from that galaxy takes two
million years to reach us. So we&rsquo;re looking two million years
back in time when we see the Andromeda nebula high up in the sky. If
there was a clever stargazer in this nebula&mdash;I can just imagine
him pointing his telescope at Earth right now&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t
be able to see us. If he was lucky, he&rsquo;d see a few flat-faced
Neanderthals.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The most distant galaxies we know of today are about ten
billion light-years away from us. When we receive signals from these
galaxies, we are going ten billion years back in the history of the
universe. That&rsquo;s about twice as long as our own solar system
has existed.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making me dizzy.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Although it is hard enough to comprehend what it means to look
so far back in time, astronomers have discovered something that has
even greater significance for our world picture.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Apparently no galaxy in space remains where it is. All the
galaxies in the universe are moving away from each other at colossal
speeds. The further they are away from us, the quicker they move.
That means that the distance between the galaxies is increasing all
the time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to picture it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If you have a balloon and you paint black spots on it, the
spots will move away from each other as you blow up the balloon.
That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening with the galaxies in the
universe. We say that the universe is expanding.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What makes it do that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Most astronomers agree that the expanding universe can only
have one explanation: Once upon a time, about 15 billion years ago,
all substance in the universe was assembled in a relatively small
area. The substance was so dense that gravity made it terrifically
hot. Finally it got so hot and so tightly packed that it exploded. We
call this explosion the Big Bang.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Just the thought of it makes me shudder.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The Big Bang caused all the substance in the universe to
be expelled in all directions, and as it gradually cooled, it formed
stars and galaxies and moons and planets ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But I thought you said the universe was still expanding?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes I did, and it&rsquo;s expanding precisely because of this
explosion billions of years ago. The universe has no timeless
geography. The universe is a happening. The universe is an explosion.
Galaxies continue to fly through the universe away from each other at
colossal speeds.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Will they go on doing that for ever?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one possibility. But there is another. You may
recall that Alberto told Sophie about the two forces that cause the
planets to remain in constant orbit round the sun?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t they gravity and inertia?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Right, and the same thing applies to the galaxies. Because
even though the universe continues to expand, the force of gravity is
working the other way. And one day, in a couple of billion years,
gravity will perhaps cause the heavenly bodies to be packed together
again as the force of the huge explosion begins to weaken. Then we
would get a reverse explosion, a so-called implosion. But the
distances are so great that it will happen like a movie that is run
in slow motion. You might compare it with what happens when you
release the air from a balloon.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Will all the galaxies be drawn together in a tight nucleus
again?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve got it. But what will happen then?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There would be another Big Bang and the universe would start
expanding again. Because the same natural laws are in operation. And
so new stars and galaxies will form.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Good thinking. Astronomers think there are two possible
scenarios for the future of the universe. Either the universe will go
on expanding forever so that the galaxies will draw further and
further apart&mdash;or the universe will begin to contract
again. How heavy and massive the universe is will determine what
happens. And this is something astronomers have no way of knowing as
yet.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But if the universe is so heavy that it begins to contract
again, perhaps it has expanded and contracted lots of times before.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That would be an obvious conclusion. But on this point theory
is divided. It may be that the expansion of the universe is something
that will only happen this one time. But if it keeps on expanding for
all eternity, the question of where it all began becomes even more
pressing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, where did it come from, all that stuff that suddenly
exploded?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;For a Christian, it would be obvious to see the Big Bang as
the actual moment of creation. The Bible tells us that God said &lsquo;Let
there be light!&rsquo; You may possibly also remember that Alberto
indicated Christianity&rsquo;s &lsquo;linear&rsquo; view of
history. From the point of view of a Christian belief in the
creation, it is better to imagine the universe continuing to expand.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It is?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In the Orient they have a &lsquo;cyclic&rsquo; view of
history.</P>
<p>
In other words, history repeats itself eternally. In India, for
example, there is an ancient theory that the world continually
unfolds and folds again, thus alternating between what Indians
have called Brahman&rsquo;s Day and Brahman&rsquo;s Night. This idea
harmonizes best, of course, with the universe expanding and
contracting&mdash;in order to expand again&mdash;in an eternal cyclic
process. I have a mental picture of a great cosmic heart that beats
and beats and beats...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think both theories are equally inconceivable and equally
exciting.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And they can compare with the great paradox of eternity that
Sophie once sat pondering in her garden: either the universe has
always been there&mdash;or it suddenly came into existence out
of nothing ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Hilde clapped her hand to her forehead.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve just been stung by a gadfly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was probably Socrates trying to sting you into life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
Sophie and Alberto had been sitting in
the red convertible listening to the major tell Hilde about the
universe.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Has it struck you that our
roles are completely reversed?&rdquo; asked Alberto after a
while.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;In what sense?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Before it was they who listened
to us, and we couldn&rsquo;t see them. Now we&rsquo;re listening to
them and they can&rsquo;t see us.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s not all.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What are you referring to?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When we started, we didn&rsquo;t
know about the other reality that Hilde and the major inhabited.
Now they don&rsquo;t know about ours.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Revenge is sweet.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But the major could intervene
in our world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Our world was nothing but his
interventions.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t yet
relinquished all hope that we may also intervene in their world.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But you know that&rsquo;s
impossible. Remember what happened in the Cinderella? I saw you
trying to get out that bottle of Coke.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie was silent. She gazed out over
the garden while the major explained about the Big Bang. There was
something about that term which started a train of thought in her
mind.</P>
<p>
She began to rummage around in the
car.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;
asked Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
She opened the glove compartment and
found a wrench. She grabbed it and jumped out of the car. She went
over to the glider and stood right in front of Hilde and her father.
First she tried to catch Hilde&rsquo;s eye but that was quite
useless. Finally she raised the wrench above her head and crashed it
down on Hilde&rsquo;s forehead.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; said Hilde.</P>
<p>
Then Sophie hit the major on his
forehead, but he didn&rsquo;t react at all.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he asked.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve just been
stung by a gadfly.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It was probably Socrates trying
to sting you into life.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie lay down on the grass and tried
to push the glider. But it remained motionless. Or did she manage to
get it to move a millimeter?</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chilly breeze
coming up,&rdquo; said Hilde.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s
very mild.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only that. There
is something.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Only the two of us and the cool
summer night.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s something in
the air.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You remember Alberto and his
secret plan?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;How could I forget!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;They simply disappeared from
the garden party. It was as if they had vanished into thin air . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;... into thin air.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The story had to end somewhere.
It was just something I wrote.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was, yes, but not what
happened afterward. Suppose they were here . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I can feel it, Dad.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie ran back to the car.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Impressive,&rdquo; said Alberto
grudgingly as she climbed on board clasping the wrench tightly in her
hand. &ldquo;You have unusual talents, Sophie. Just wait and see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
The major put his arm around Hilde.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you hear the mysterious play of the waves?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. We must get the boat in the water tomorrow.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But do you hear the strange whispering of the wind? Look how
the aspen leaves are trembling.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The planet is alive, you know ...&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You wrote that there was something between the lines.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I did?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps there is something between the lines in this garden
too.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Nature is full of enigmas. But we are talking about stars in
the sky.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Soon there will be stars on the water.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s what you used to say about
phosphorescence when you were little. And in a sense you were right.
Phosphorescence and all other organisms are made of elements that
were once blended together in a star.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Us too?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we too are stardust.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was beautifully put.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;When radio telescopes can pick up light from distant galaxies
billions of light-years away, they will be charting the universe
as it looked in primeval times after the Big Bang. Everything we can
see in the sky is a cosmic fossil from thousands and millions of
years ago. The only thing an astrologer can do is predict the past.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Because the stars in the constellations moved away from each
other long before their light reached us, right?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Even two thousand years ago, the constellations looked
considerably different from the way they look today.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I never knew that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a clear night, we can see millions, even
billions of years back into the history of the universe. So in a
way, we are going home.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;You and I also began with the Big Bang, because all substance
in the universe is an organic unity. Once in a primeval age all
matter was gathered in a clump so enormously massive that a pinhead
weighed many billions of tons. This &lsquo;primeval atom&rsquo;
exploded because of the enormous gravitation. It was as if something
disintegrated. When we look up at the sky, we are trying to find
the way back to ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What an extraordinary thing to say.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;All the stars and galaxies in the universe are made of the
same substance. Parts of it have lumped themselves together,
some here, some there. There can be billions of light-years between
one galaxy and the next. But they all have the same origin. All stars
and all planets belong to the same family.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But what is this earthly substance? What was it that exploded
that time billions of years ago? Where did it come from?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That is the big question.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;And a question that concerns us all very deeply. For we
ourselves are of that substance. We are a spark from the great fire
that was ignited many billions of years ago.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a beautiful thought too.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;However, we must not exaggerate the importance of these
figures. It is enough just to hold a stone in your hand. The universe
would have been equally incomprehensible if it had only
consisted of that one stone the size of an orange. The question would
be just as impenetrable: where did this stone come from?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
Sophie suddenly stood up in the red
convertible and pointed out over the bay.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I want to try the rowboat,&rdquo;
she said.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tied up. And we
would never be able to lift the oars.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall we try? After all, it is
Midsummer Eve.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We can go down to the water, at
any rate.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
They jumped out of the car and ran
down the garden.</P>
<p>
They tried to loosen the rope that was
made fast in a metal ring. But they could not even lift one end.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as nailed
down,&rdquo; said Alberto.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got plenty of
time.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A true philosopher must never
give up. If we could just... get it loose . . .&rdquo;</P>
<p>
<BR>
</P>
<p>
&ldquo;There are more stars now,&rdquo; said Hilde.</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, when the summer night is darkest.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;But they sparkle more in winter. Do you remember the night
before you left for Lebanon? It was New Year&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;That was when I decided to write a book about philosophy
for you. I had been to a large bookstore in Kris-tiansand and to the
library too. But they had nothing suitable for young people.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if we are sitting at the very tip of the fine
hairs in the white rabbit&rsquo;s fur.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if there is anyone out there in the night of the
light-years?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;The rowboat has worked itself loose!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;So it has!&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it. I went down and checked it just
before you got here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;It reminds me of when Sophie borrowed Alberto&rsquo;s boat. Do
you remember how it lay drifting out in the lake?&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;I bet it&rsquo;s her at work again.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Go ahead and make fun of me. All evening, I&rsquo;ve been able
to feel someone here.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;One of us will have to swim out to it.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll both go, Dad.&rdquo;</P>

&ldquo;First, think of a beginner&rsquo;s guide to philosophy,
written by a schoolteacher ... Next, imagine a fantasy novel&mdash;
something like a modern-day version of Through the Looking Glass.
Meld these disparate genres, and what do you get? Well, what you get
is an improbable international bestseller ... a runaway hit... [a]
tour deforce.&rdquo;</P>

&ldquo;Compelling.&rdquo; &mdash;Los Angeles Times</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Its depth of learning, its intelligence and its totally
original conception give it enormous magnetic appeal ... To be fully
human, and to feel our continuity with 3,000 years of philosophical
inquiry, we need to put ourselves in Sophie&rsquo;s world.&rdquo;
&mdash;Boston Sunday Globe</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Involving and often humorous.&rdquo; &mdash;USA Today</P>

&ldquo;In the adroit hands of Jostein Gaarder, the whole sweep of
three millennia of Western philosophy is rendered as lively as a
gossip column ... Literary sorcery of the first rank.&rdquo; &mdash;Fort
Worth Star-Telegram</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A comprehensive history of Western philosophy as recounted
to a 14-year-old Norwegian schoolgirl... The book will serve as a
first-rate introduction to anyone who never took an introductory
philosophy course, and as a pleasant refresher for those who have and
have forgotten most of it... [Sophie&rsquo;s mother] is a marvelous
comic foil.&rdquo; &mdash;Newsweek</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Terrifically entertaining and imaginative ... I&rsquo;ll read
Sophie&rsquo;s World again.&rdquo; &mdash;Daily Mail</P>
<p>
&ldquo;What is admirable in the novel is the utter unpretentious-ness
of the philosophical lessons, the plain and workmanlike prose
which manages to deliver Western philosophy in accounts that are
crystal clear. It is heartening to know that a book subtitled

&ldquo;&rsquo;A Novel About the History of Philosophy&rsquo; was not
only a bestseller in France, but for a while Europe&rsquo;s hottest
novel.&rdquo;</P>
<p>

</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A rare bird indeed, a short history of Western philosophical
thought from Socrates to Sartre, coyly embedded in the wrapping of a
suspense novel.&rdquo; &mdash;New York Newsday</P>
<p>
&ldquo;A simply wonderful, irresistible book ... a cross between
Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s History of Western Philosophy and Alice in
Wonderland.&rdquo; &mdash;The Daily Telegraph</P>

philosophers&rsquo; school of Athens to the Konigsberg of Kant... and
a brilliant success.&rdquo; -Der Spiegel</P>

&ldquo;Intelligently   written... an   enchanting   way   to   learn
philosophy.&rdquo; &mdash;Baton Rouge Magazine</P>
<p>
&ldquo;Just as remarkable for its playful premise as it is for its
accessibility ... The essential charm of Sophie&rsquo;s World lies in
the innocent curiosity of the young character, and the clever
narrative structure Gaarder designed to pique it.&rdquo;</P>
